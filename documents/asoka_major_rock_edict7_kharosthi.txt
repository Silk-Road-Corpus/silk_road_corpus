[Shahbazgarhi Text]
King Priyadaśi, Beloved of the Gods, wishes that all
religious sects should live harmoniously in all parts of his
dominions. In fact, all of them desire to achieve self-control
and purity of thought. People, however, are of
diverse inclinations and diverse passions. They will
perform either the whole or only a part of their duty.
However, even if a person practises great liberality but does
not possess self-control, purity of thought, gratitude and
firm devotion, he is quite worthless.
