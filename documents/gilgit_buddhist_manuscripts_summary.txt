According to the preface of this publication written in 1959, the set of Gilgit 
Buddhist Manuscripts contain photographic reproductions of the manuscripts discovered
by Sir Aurel Stein in July 1931. Some of the original manuscripts were later moved to
the British Museum in London and some found their way into private hands then later to
Professor Tucci, from which the Internationa Academy of Indian Culture made
reproductions.

The manuscripts were originally made on birch bark and now in the National Archives of
India, in Delhi.
