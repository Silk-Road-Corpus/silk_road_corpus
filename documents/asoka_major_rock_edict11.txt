King Devanampriya Priyadarsin speaks thus,

There is no such gift as the gift of morality, the distribution of morality, (and) kinship through morality(Dhamma Niti).

Herein the following (are comprised), (viz.) proper courtesy to slaves and servants, obedience to mother and father, liberality to friends, acquaintances, and relatives, to Sramanas and Brahmanas, (and) abstention from killing animals.

Concerning this a father, or a son, or a brother, or a master, (or) a friend or an acquaintance, (or) even a (mere) neighbour, ought to say "This is meritorious. This ought to be done".

If one is acting thus, (happiness) in this world is attained, and endless merit is produced in the other (world) by that gift of morality.
