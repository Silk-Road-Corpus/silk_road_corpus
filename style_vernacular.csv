The only potential vernacular element found is the reduplication of '念' (niàn) as '念念' (niànniàn), which, while often functioning adverbially (e.g., in '念念不忘' meaning 'constantly remembering'), can also be understood as a reduplicated noun (e.g., 'thought by thought' or 'moment by moment'), indicating a slight move towards more expressive, repetitive phrasing.",
