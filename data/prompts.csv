Yes, 施色力經 (Shī Sè Lì Jīng) is listed as a synonym for another title.

The text lists it as an alternate name (一名) for the sutra titled 食施獲五福報經 (Shí Shī Huò Wǔ Fú Bào Jīng). It also provides a third synonym, 福德經 (Fú Dé Jīng).

The full entry, found at line [0509c22], is:

Translation of the entry:
Sutra on Receiving Five Fortunes from Food Offerings, 1 fascicle (Also known as: Sutra on Granting Vigor and Strength, also known as: Sutra on Merit and Virtue. This is a different translation of a text from the 24th fascicle of the Ekottarika Āgama).

2. Which fascicle is it listed in?
It is listed in 卷第三 (Fascicle 3) of the Kaiyuan Lu.

,,gemini-2.5-flash,"施色力經, t2154.txt","Is the title 施色力經 a synonym for any other titles listed in the given text (Kaiyuan Lu)?
Yes, the text explicitly states that 施色力經 (Shī sè lì jīng) is a synonym for two other titles:

食施獲五福報經 (Shí shī huò wǔ fú bào jīng - Sutra of Obtaining Five Blessings from Giving Food) - The entry states: 食施獲五福報經一卷 (一名施色力經一名福德經出增一阿含第二十四卷異譯). This directly translates to ""One卷 of the Sutra of Obtaining Five Blessings from Giving Food (also named the Shī sè lì jīng, also named the Fú dé jīng, a different translation from Exottarāgama Chapter 24).""
福德經 (Fú dé jīng - Sutra of Merit/Blessing) - As seen in the same parenthetical note above, it is also listed as an alternative name.
Which fascicle is it listed in?
It is listed in 開元釋教錄卷第二十 (Kaiyuan Shijiao Lu, Fascicle 20).

,,gemini-2.5-pro,"河中大聚沫經, t2154.txt","1. Is the title 河中大聚沫經 a synonym for any other titles listed in the given text?
Yes, the title 河中大聚沫經 is explicitly listed with synonyms in the text. It is also related to another title through a shared synonym.

In its own entry, it is listed as a synonym for 水沫所漂經 (Sutra on Being Carried Away by Water Foam) and 聚沫譬經 (Sutra on the Parable of Foam).

[0485c01] 河中大聚沫經一卷 (或云水沫所漂經或云聚沫譬經眾經錄云出雜阿含今以安錄 先集雜含後譯是別譯本非從彼出)

Translation: Hézhōng dà jù mò jīng, one fascicle (also called Shuǐ mò suǒ piāo jīng or Jù mò pì jīng. The Zhongjing Lu states it is from the Miscellaneous Āgama, but as the An Lu collected the Miscellaneous Āgama before this was translated, this is a separate translation and not an excerpt from it.)

Furthermore, by cross-referencing within the text, we find that 水沫所漂經 is also listed as an alternate title for 五陰譬喻經 (Sutra on the Parable of the Five Skandhas).

[0479c20] 五陰譬喻經一卷 (或無譬字一名水沫所漂經出雜阿含第十卷異譯見朱士行漢錄及僧 祐錄)

Translation: Wǔ yīn pìyù jīng, one fascicle (or without the character ""pì,"" another name is Shuǐ mò suǒ piāo jīng, a different translation from the tenth fascicle of the Miscellaneous Āgama...)

Therefore, through this connection, 河中大聚沫經 is synonymous with or directly related to 五陰譬喻經.

The title is listed in Fascicle One (卷第一) of the Kaiyuan釋教錄.

In all instances where ""耳"" appears, it functions as a noun referring to the ear (part of the sense organs) or as part of a compound noun related to the ear:

[0235c20] ""眼見色亦不喜亦不惡，但觀行意正知。耳鼻口身意法觀..."" (Ear, nose, mouth, body, mind observation)
[0235c23] ""六內入，眼內入，耳鼻口身意內入。"" (Six internal sense bases: eye sense base, ear, nose, mouth, body, mind sense bases)
[0235c24] ""六愛，眼更愛，耳鼻口身意更愛。"" (Six defilements: eye contact defilement, ear, nose, mouth, body, mind contact defilement)
[0240c23] ""三為耳入、四為聲入..."" (Third is ear sense base, fourth is sound sense base...)
Therefore, in this text, ""耳"" consistently denotes the biological organ or the corresponding sense base, and does not serve as a grammatical final particle.",Y,This is the correct response. There are four occurrences of 耳 in the text and they all refer to ‘ear’.
