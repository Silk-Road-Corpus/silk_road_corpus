It is an exposition of Buddhist principles and practices, fitting the description of a sutra.The text was translated by An Shigao, a renowned figure for early Buddhist translations, particularly those focused on meditation and Abhidharma. The content, which systematizes various Buddhist teachings on the path (如是行者，但當一切捨，使行道地從後來 - practitioners should abandon everything to follow the path-stages), is suitable for the 'Collected Sūtras' category. The text does not contain distinctly Mahāyāna doctrines such as universal salvation, the Trikāya, or a highly developed concept of śūnyatā as found in Prajñāpāramitā sūtras. It focuses on individual liberation through understanding suffering, impermanence, and non-self, consistent with early Buddhist teachings. The text utilizes numerous analogies and similes to clarify complex teachings, such as comparing the body to various decaying objects, or the process of seeking fire from wood to the practice of meditation. These are primarily explanatory rather than miraculous tales of salvation. The text is a primary discourse, not a commentary on another work, nor an Abhidharma treatise in the scholastic sense. The text is presented as a continuous teaching, primarily by the Buddha, rather than an interactive dialogue between multiple parties. While rhetorical questions are posed, the answers are immediately supplied by the speaker. The Buddha is clearly identified as the speaker (e.g., ""佛言"" - The Buddha said). No dharanis (mystical incantations) are found within the text. The text extensively uses logical reasoning to explain the nature of existence, the aggregates, and the path to liberation. For example, the detailed breakdown of the body's formation and decay serves as a philosophical argument for impermanence and suffering. The text employs persuasive language, vivid imagery, and numerous analogies to emphasize its teachings and evoke understanding and conviction in the reader. This includes graphic descriptions of the body's impurity, illness, and death. Chapter 5 explicitly describes how actions lead to specific rebirths in different realms (heaven, human, animal, hungry ghost, hell), directly addressing the concept of karmic retribution. The text does not mention any specific historical individuals by name within its narrative. The text mentions ",0,False,,,False,,False,False,False,False,[],[],[],[],,

This content is characteristic of early Buddhist teachings found in the Āgama (阿含) literature, hence its classification as such and not Mahāyāna. The text is structured as a detailed dialogue between the Buddha and Ananda, with the Buddha systematically deconstructing concepts of self and suffering through a series of logical inquiries and rhetorical questions, which demonstrates philosophical argumentation and rhetoric. While various 'deva' realms (天) are mentioned as stages of meditative attainment, they are not presented as deities for worship in a devotional sense.",
阿毘曇五法經,T 1557,sutra,Abhidharma,False,,Abhidharma,False,,False,False,False,True,[],[],[],[],"The title ""阿毘曇五法行經"" (Abhidharma Five Practices Sūtra) explicitly indicates its Taishō genre as Abhidharma, which is confirmed by the highly systematic and analytical nature of the text. It meticulously defines and categorizes Buddhist concepts such as the Four Noble Truths (苦法, 習法, 盡法, 道法), the Five Aggregates/Practices (五法行: 色, 意, 所念, 別離意行, 無為), various mental factors, defilements (結, 使), and types of wisdom (黠). The text is an exposition of doctrine, not a narrative or a commentary on another text. It does not contain Mahāyāna specific doctrines, dhāraṇīs, or a sustained dialogue. It explicitly mentions karmic retribution with phrases like ""作善上天。作惡入惡"" (doing good leads to heaven, doing evil leads to evil paths).",
十報經,T 13,sutra,Āgama,False,,,True,Śāriputra,False,False,False,False,"['Śāriputra', 'Buddha']","['Brahma', 'Devas']","['Jetavana', 'Śrāvastī']",[],"The text is an enumeration of Buddhist doctrines and practices, structured as 'one dharma, two dharmas, ..., ten dharmas'. It begins with Śāriputra addressing the bhikṣus, making it primarily a dialogue. Its title '長阿含十報法經' explicitly identifies it as belonging to the Dirgha Āgama (長阿含) collection. The content focuses on fundamental Buddhist teachings without incorporating distinct Mahāyāna concepts like emptiness (śūnyatā) in its Mahāyāna sense, the bodhisattva path, or Trikāya doctrine. It is didactic and enumerative rather than engaging in philosophical argumentation or elaborate rhetoric. While karma and retribution are mentioned as concepts understood by the Buddha, there are no specific stories illustrating karmic retribution. No dhāraṇīs, parables, or miracle tales are present.",
普法義經,T 98,sutra,Āgama,False,,,False,Śāriputra,False,True,True,True,"['Śāriputra', 'Buddha']",[],"['Jetavana', 'Śrāvastī']",[],"The text is titled 'Sūtra Spoken by the Buddha on Universal Dharma Meanings' and begins with 'Thus have I heard', indicating it is a sūtra. The content, delivered by Śāriputra to bhikkhus, focuses on practical ethical conduct, mental cultivation, the development of wisdom (prajñā), and the cessation of suffering to attain the unconditioned (無為), which aligns with early Buddhist teachings and the path of an Arhat. There are no distinct Mahāyāna doctrines such as the Bodhisattva path, extensive emptiness teachings, or elaborate cosmological elements. The text contains structured lists of practices, obstacles, and insights (e.g., 'twelve assemblies', 'twenty items to explain', 'sixteen practices to hear the Dharma', 'ten thoughts', 'fourteen evil dharmas', 'twenty things that hinder the path', 'twenty things that quicken the mind') which constitutes philosophical argumentation regarding the Buddhist path and significant rhetoric for instruction. Karmic retribution is explicitly mentioned: 'Each obtains from their actions, each from the root of their actions, each receives suffering from their actions, each performs good and evil, and receives according to their actions'. The main discourse is a monologue by Śāriputra.",
漏分布經,T 57,sutra,Āgama,False,,,True,Buddha,False,True,True,True,"['Buddha', 'An Shigao']",[],['Kuru country'],['Madhyama Āgama'],"The text is a Sūtra from the Āgama collection, specifically referencing the Madhyama Āgama. It is not Mahāyāna. The text is presented as a discourse by the Buddha to bhikkhus, with their occasional response, making it a dialog. It systematically analyzes concepts such as 'leaks' (漏), 'pain' (痛), 'thoughts' (思想), 'desire' (愛欲), 'actions' (行), and 'suffering' (苦), detailing their nature, origin, consequences, distribution, cessation, and the path to their end (the Eightfold Path). This structured analysis constitutes philosophical argumentation. The highly repetitive phrasing, particularly for the five aspects of each concept (e.g., ""當知X，亦當知X從本有，亦當知從X受殃，亦當知X分布，亦當知X盡，亦當知受何行令X畢""), serves as a rhetorical device for emphasis and memorization. The text explicitly discusses the karmic consequences of actions, leading to good or bad rebirths, indicating karmic retribution.",

The title, 'Sūtra on Seven Places and Three Contemplations', refers to the first and longest discourse, which details a systematic analysis of the five skandhas and three types of contemplation. The content focuses on foundational Buddhist teachings such as the nature of suffering, impermanence, non-self, the five skandhas, karmic causality, ethical conduct, and the path to liberation (Nirvana). The translation by An Shigao is consistent with early Buddhist texts, rather than Mahāyāna. Several parables are used, including analogies of a house, clouds, a body as a 'swelling', and a tree, to explain complex concepts. The text also includes explicit discussions of karmic retribution, particularly regarding unwholesome actions leading to suffering and wholesome actions leading to well-being and higher rebirths. The discourses are presented primarily as dialogues between the Buddha and his disciples or other interlocutors.",

It is structured as an extensive dialogue between the Buddha and various Bodhisattvas. The Buddha engages in deep philosophical argumentation by systematically analyzing '108' categories of defilements (ignorance, doubt, perversions, desires, falls, attachments, hindrances, sinful consciousness, causes of pain, kinds of pain) in relation to the six sense faculties (mind, intellect, consciousness, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, body) and the five skandhas. He uses rhetorical questions to guide the Bodhisattvas to self-reflection and deeper understanding. The analogy of the 'licentious jealous woman' serves as a parable to illustrate the consequences of unacknowledged defilements and pain, thereby implying karmic retribution. No specific historical people by name are mentioned within the sūtra content, only the Buddha and Bodhisattvas as categories. The reference to 'Mingdu Jing' in the appended editorial note is about the collation process, not an internal reference within the text itself.",

The 'taisho_genre' is 'Āgama' as this text (T602) is classified within the Āgama section of the Taishō Tripiṭaka. The 'is_mahayana' field is set to 'true' because the preface by Kang Senghui explicitly states, '夫安般者，諸佛之大乘' (Anapanasati is the Great Vehicle of all Buddhas), indicating a Mahāyāna interpretation of the practice, even though the core meditation instructions themselves are foundational to early Buddhism. The text contains explicit '問' (question) and '報' (answer) sections, making it mostly a 'dialog'. The 'speaker' is the 'Buddha' as indicated by '佛說' (Buddha taught). The text includes discussions of '罪' (sins/faults) and '福' (merits) in relation to practice and obstacles, and references '畢故罪' (ending old sins) and '不受新' (not receiving new [sins]), which signifies 'karmic_retribution'. The text contains philosophical analysis of mind, causality, and the nature of reality, such as '意從因緣生' (mind arises from causes and conditions), qualifying as 'philosophical_argumentation'. The preface by Kang Senghui is highly rhetorical, and the sūtra's explanations use persuasive language. 'Anqing' is listed under deities because the text refers to '有菩薩名安清' (there was a Bodhisattva named Anqing), fulfilling the criteria for including Bodhisattvas as deities. 'An Shigao' is the historical translator who is also identified as the Bodhisattva Anqing. The 'text_references' include '三十七品經' (thirty-seven factors of enlightenment) and '十二部經' (Twelve Divisions of the Buddhist Canon), which are canonical frameworks or categories explicitly mentioned.",
五陰喻經,T 105,sutra,Āgama,False,parable,,False,Buddha,False,True,True,False,['Buddha'],[],['靡勝國'],[],"The text is a sūtra as indicated by its title ending in '經' and the opening '聞如是'. Its content, focusing on the impermanence and non-self nature of the five aggregates using various similes, is characteristic of early Buddhist teachings found in the Āgamas. The translator, An Shigao, is known for translating early Buddhist texts. The text employs a series of parables (foam, bubble, mirage, banana tree, illusion) to illustrate its points, thus qualifying as a 'parable'. While the Buddha addresses his disciples, the discourse is a continuous sermon rather than a back-and-forth dialogue. It contains philosophical argumentation by systematically explaining the nature of the aggregates and also uses repetitive phrases and vivid similes for rhetorical effect. There are no mentions of specific karmic retribution stories or dharanis. The Buddha is the speaker and the only named historical figure mentioned within the narrative. '靡勝國' (Mishong kingdom) is the only specific place mentioned in the body of the text.",

流攝經,T 31,sutra,Āgama,False,,,True,Buddha,False,True,True,True,"['Buddha', 'An Shigao']",[],['Kuru kingdom'],[],"The text is clearly identified as a 'Sūtra' (經) in its title, making its 'top_level_genre' 'sutra'. It discusses fundamental Buddhist concepts like 'outflows' (流, āsravas) and the path to liberation by ending them, a common theme in early Buddhist discourses. The style and content are characteristic of early Buddhist teachings, fitting the 'Āgama' genre. It does not present Mahāyāna specific doctrines or figures. The text is presented as a discourse delivered by the Buddha to his disciples ('佛告比丘：『比丘！』應：『唯然。』比丘便從佛受教'), indicating it is a 'dialog'. The primary 'speaker' is the Buddha. No dhāraṇīs are present. The text systematically explains the nature of 'outflows' and the methods to abandon them (e.g., through 'seeing', 'guarding', 'avoiding', 'using', 'enduring', 'understanding', 'cultivating'), which constitutes 'philosophical argumentation' regarding the path to liberation. The Buddha employs direct address and structured exposition to persuade and instruct, indicating 'rhetoric'. The text mentions that performing good or evil actions leads to consequences ('善惡受罪') and that attaining liberation prevents falling into 'evil destinies' ('不復墮惡處'), thus containing the concept of 'karmic retribution' or 'karmic causes and conditions', even if not as a specific story. 'Historical_people' includes the Buddha (Śākyamuni) as the speaker and An Shigao, the translator, who is mentioned in the colophon of the provided text. 'Places' include 'Kuru kingdom' (拘留國). As a sūtra, it is not a commentary and therefore does not reference other texts in that capacity.",
是法非法經,T 48,sutra,Āgama,False,,,True,Buddha,False,False,True,False,"['Buddha', 'Bhikkhus']",[],"['Jetavana', 'Sravasti']",[],"The text is a sūtra from the Madhyama Āgama, as indicated by ""出《中阿含》"" and the opening phrase ""聞如是"". It presents a discourse by the Buddha to bhikkhus, who respond at the beginning, hence it is considered a dialog. It is not Mahāyāna, as Āgama texts predate or are distinct from Mahāyāna. There are no parables, miracle tales, or stories of karmic retribution. It does not contain a dhāraṇī. The text employs rhetoric through its repetitive structure and antithetical presentation of 'wise' and 'unwise' conduct to emphasize moral teachings. It focuses on ethical conduct rather than complex philosophical argumentation. No deities other than the Buddha are mentioned. The translator, An Shigao, is not included in 'historical_people' as he is not a character within the text.",

Its content, which systematically explains the chains of dependent arising (pratītyasamutpāda) leading to suffering (from non-virtuous association to craving) and liberation (from virtuous association to the seven factors of awakening and freedom), is characteristic of Āgama teachings. It explicitly mentions fundamental Buddhist concepts such as the five hindrances, three evil actions, sense restraint, faith, mindfulness, four foundations of mindfulness, and the seven factors of awakening. There are no Mahāyāna specific doctrines or figures. The text is presented as a discourse by the Buddha to bhikṣus, rather than a back-and-forth dialogue. The structured, repetitive explanation of cause and effect for both conditioned existence and liberation constitutes philosophical argumentation, and the repetitive phrasing serves a rhetorical purpose. The explanation of how actions and mental states lead to specific outcomes (suffering or liberation) directly relates to karmic causes and conditions.",

Its nature as an expository and analytical work makes 'commentary' and 'treatise' appropriate for the top-level and commentary type genres respectively. It systematically defines concepts, analyzes components of existence, and explains their interrelationships, demonstrating philosophical argumentation. The discussion of good and evil actions leading to different outcomes, including falling into hell for certain behaviors, indicates the presence of karmic retribution. It does not exhibit distinct Mahāyāna characteristics or contain any dhāraṇīs. The translators, An Xuan and Yan Fotiao, and the Buddha (as the source of a teaching) are mentioned historical figures. It is not presented as a dialogue.",

The inclusion of a preface which is a commentary means the ""commentary_type"" is set to ""sūtra commentary"", even though the main body is a sūtra.

It features extensive dialogues between the Buddha and various disciples and deities. The core content involves philosophical argumentation on the nature of Prajñāpāramitā, emptiness, non-attachment, and the skandhas. It uses rhetorical devices such as repetitive questions and exclamations to emphasize key points. A significant portion of the text discusses severe karmic retribution for those who slander or reject the deep Prajñāpāramitā teachings, including descriptions of suffering in hells.

It is primarily a dialogue involving the Buddha, Śakra, Subhūti, and Ananda, though the Buddha is the ultimate teacher. It contains significant philosophical argumentation, particularly regarding emptiness (空) and non-attainment (無所得), and employs extensive rhetoric to emphasize the merits of practicing Prajñāpāramitā. Karmic retribution is present in discussions of the consequences of actions like pride and quarreling, and the benefits of supporting bodhisattvas. The text uses various analogies (e.g., illusion, wooden man, boat, land, sun, water) to illustrate its points, but these are not full narrative parables or miracle tales as defined in the rubric.",

It features extensive dialogues primarily between the Buddha and his disciples Ānanda and Subhūti. The story of Sadhāparibhūta Bodhisattva's arduous quest for Prajñāpāramitā, involving self-sacrifice and divine intervention (like Indra's test and the apparition of a Buddha), classifies it as a miracle tale. The text extensively uses philosophical argumentation regarding emptiness (空), non-origination, and the nature of phenomena, and employs rhetoric through persuasive language and analogies to emphasize the importance of Prajñāpāramitā. The narrative of Sadhāparibhūta highlights the accumulation of merit from past lives (karmic causes and conditions). No explicit dhāraṇī is found. Deities include Buddhas other than Śākyamuni, bodhisattvas like Dharmodgata and Sadhāparibhūta, and other supernatural beings like Indra and Maara. Historical people listed are the Buddha's direct disciples.",

It is classified under 'Collected Sūtras' as it is a specific Mahāyāna sūtra not belonging to the larger, named Mahāyāna collections. Its Mahāyāna nature is evident through the presence of Bodhisattvas, the aspiration for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, and the visualization of innumerable Buddhas. The text features several narratives, including the extensive exposition of immense merits in Chapter 13 and stories of past lives and encounters with Buddhas in Chapters 14 and 15, all serving as parables to illustrate profound teachings and the benefits of practicing the samadhi. The account of Buddha's spiritual power making Bhadrapala's house vast and transparent (Chapter 10) also contains elements of a miracle tale. The text lacks an explicit dhāraṇī. Philosophical argumentation is present in discussions of concepts like emptiness, non-attachment, non-arising, and the nature of the 'Buddha Seal'. Rhetorical devices are used, such as gathas (verses), grand comparisons for merit, and persuasive language. The narratives of past lives and the attainment of Buddhahood or auspicious rebirths due to practicing or supporting the samadhi illustrate positive karmic causes and conditions. Historical figures like Śākyamuni and his direct disciples (Śāriputra, Maudgalyayana, Ānanda) are mentioned. Various Bodhisattvas, other Buddhas from past eons, and heavenly beings are listed as deities. Rājagṛha, Jambudvīpa, and Bhadraṅga are identified as places. No external texts are referenced as this is a sūtra itself, not a commentary.",

It is classified as Mahayana due to its central focus on the Bodhisattva path, the emphasis on emptiness (空), great compassion (大慈), and its explicit comparisons and contrasts between the Bodhisattva path and the paths of Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas. The Taishō genre 'Collected Sūtras' (經集) is chosen because it is a Mahayana sūtra that doesn't fit into the more specific major Mahayana sūtra categories like Prajñāpāramitā or Lotus, but rather presents a compilation of teachings on various aspects of the Bodhisattva path and wisdom. The text contains numerous similes and analogies, often introduced by '譬如', serving as parables to explain complex Buddhist concepts. Philosophical argumentation is evident in discussions concerning emptiness, non-self, the nature of mind, and the correct understanding of precepts, often through a dialectical or negational approach. Rhetoric is present through the use of persuasive language, rhetorical questions, and the structured 'four things' (四事) lists that categorize virtues and faults. Karmic retribution is discussed in relation to actions leading to the loss or gain of Bodhisattva intent and the consequences of past deeds. The text is structured as a dialogue, primarily between the Buddha and Mahākāśyapa, and later involving Subhūti and a group of 500 monks. No dhāraṇīs or explicit references to other texts are found within the sūtra's body.",

Its classification within the Taishō Tripiṭaka (T.626) places it in the 'Ratnakūṭa' collection. It is definitively Mahāyāna, featuring prominent Bodhisattvas (especially Mañjuśrī), profound emptiness teachings, and the Bodhisattva path. The narratives of salvation for King Ajātaśatru and others through understanding the Dharma, along with Mañjuśrī's supernatural abilities, qualify as 'miracle_tale'. The text is extensively presented in dialogue format. The Buddha is identified as the primary speaker, as indicated by the title 'Buddha Speaks' and his ultimate authority within the text. The text explicitly contains a dhāraṇī taught by Mañjuśrī. It features extensive philosophical argumentation on topics such as emptiness, non-duality, and the nature of mind. Rhetorical devices such as similes and analogies are frequently used. The central theme of King Ajātaśatru's parricide and subsequent liberation through the Dharma directly addresses karmic retribution. Historical figures like King Ajātaśatru, Mahākāśyapa, Śāriputra, Ānanda, Śākyamuni Buddha, and others are mentioned. Deities include various Bodhisattvas (Mañjuśrī, Maitreya, etc.), Deva kings, Yakṣas, Brahmā, and Nāga kings. Specific places like Rājagṛha, Jambudvīpa, and various heavenly and hell realms are named. As a sūtra, it does not reference other texts.",

Its Taishō genre is 'Mahāsaṃnipāta' given the emphasis on a vast assembly of countless Bodhisattvas from innumerable Buddha-fields, the description of many Buddhas, and the grand cosmic scale, all characteristic of the Mahāsaṃnipāta collection. It is Mahāyāna because of the prominent role of Bodhisattvas, the concept of multiple Buddha-fields, and the expansive cosmology. The text has dialogic elements, as Bodhisattvas express their thoughts and requests, and Mañjuśrī speaks, with the Buddha responding through a display of light and power. Rhetoric is present through extensive use of hyperbole and enumeration to describe the inconceivable vastness of Buddha-realms and the Buddha's powers, aiming to inspire awe and devotion.",

It is presented as a dialogue primarily between Śākyamuni Buddha and Śāriputra. It is clearly Mahāyāna due to its focus on Bodhisattva vows and pure lands. The detailed descriptions of the miraculous qualities of Akṣobhya's land and the events surrounding his Buddhahood are considered 'miracle_tale'. It does not contain philosophical argumentation but uses rhetorical language to emphasize the virtues and wonders described. The emphasis on vows leading to specific outcomes reflects karmic cause and effect.,

Although it contains many early Buddhist narratives, the explicit mention of '發大乘者' (those who arouse the Mahayana aspiration) and the general theme of universal salvation indicate a Mahāyāna context. The text is largely presented through dialogue. While Ānanda introduces the text, the primary speaker of the teachings is the Buddha. Both parables (like the King Akrodha story illustrating patience) and miracle tales (e.g., the Buddha's various feats to convert Kāśyapa) are present. The Buddha's actions and teachings on topics like the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path involve philosophical argumentation. Rhetorical devices are frequently used in descriptions and persuasive discourse. Karmic retribution is directly discussed, for instance, in the story of King Akrodha and the explanation for birth defects. Regarding historical people, '十力迦葉' is identified as one of the five bhikṣus (Aśvajit). '頞陛' is also used for another bhikṣu Assaji who converted Śāriputra. The text mentions '舍夷' (Śrāvastī) as the destination for the Buddha's return journey in chapter six, but the following narrative involves '迦維羅越王閱頭檀' (King Śuddhodana of Kapilavastu), indicating a potential conflation of locations; both are listed.",

It is not considered Mahāyāna as it lacks characteristic Mahāyāna doctrines and terminology. The text contains numerous miracle tales, such as divine guidance, miraculous protection, and supernatural transformations, as well as parables used for teaching. It is structured largely as a dialogue, with the Buddha as the primary speaker. While containing philosophical elements, the argumentation is not highly systematic. Rhetoric is present in the Buddha's persuasive teaching style. Karmic retribution is a central theme, with several explicit stories demonstrating the consequences of past actions. Historical figures include the Buddha Śākyamuni and his key disciples, kings, queens, and non-Buddhist teachers. Deities listed include past Buddhas, heavenly beings, and spirits. The instructions specify that Buddhas 'other than Śākyamuni' should be listed under 'deities'; thus, Śākyamuni Buddha is listed under 'historical_people' to adhere strictly to the rubric. The text does not contain dhāraṇīs or explicit references to other texts as a commentary would.",

The Taishō genre 'Collected Sūtras' is the most appropriate general classification for this prominent, standalone Mahāyāna sūtra. The text is almost entirely composed of dialogues, with Vimalakīrti often serving as the primary expositor of profound Mahāyāna teachings. While it mentions karmic causes and conditions (e.g., actions leading to different realms), it does not feature specific narrative tales of karmic retribution. Philosophical argumentation, especially on emptiness and non-duality, is a central theme, and the language throughout is highly rhetorical and persuasive.

It aligns with the Nirvāṇa genre of the Taishō Tripiṭaka. It is not considered Mahāyāna as its teachings focus on foundational Buddhist doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, and the attainment of arhatship, without incorporating distinct Mahāyāna philosophical concepts like emptiness (śūnyatā) in its fully developed form or the bodhisattva path as a universal ideal beyond the Buddha's own prior path. The narrative is largely dialogical, featuring exchanges between the Buddha and his disciples, as well as various lay figures and deities. It contains a parable-like story of King 快見 (Kuaixian) as a past life of the Buddha, illustrating karmic causes and conditions. Philosophical argumentation is present in the detailed expositions of Buddhist doctrines and practices. Rhetoric is used throughout to emphasize teachings and persuade listeners. Karmic retribution is a central theme, explaining the consequences of actions and their impact on rebirth and spiritual development.

It mentions the practice of the Six Perfections (六度無極), which is a key Mahāyāna concept, thus leading to the 'is_mahayana: true' classification. The text contains numerous miracle tales, such as the Buddha taming the naga, instantly traveling to fetch rare fruits, and controlling fire and water. Philosophical argumentation is present in the discussion of the twelve links of dependent origination and the subtle nature of the Dharma. Dialogues are frequent, particularly between the Buddha and Brahma, and the Buddha and Kāśyapa.

It is classified as Prajñāpāramitā due to its extensive philosophical discussions on emptiness (空), non-duality (無二), the inconceivable nature of the Buddha's body (佛身), and the profound wisdom (慧) associated with the samādhi. The dialogue format, especially with Śāriputra and Mañjuśrī, is characteristic of this genre. The narrative about King Hui Shang (慧上), who is revealed to be Amitābha Buddha in a past life, and his 1000 sons becoming future Buddhas, functions as a parable illustrating the immense merits and transformative power of practicing this specific samādhi. While '陀隣尼' (dhāraṇī) is frequently mentioned as an attainment or a 'door' to practice, no specific dhāraṇī mantra is recited within the text. The text contains explicit discussions of karmic results, both positive (e.g., eradicating sins, attaining Buddhahood) and negative (e.g., suffering from various ailments, being born in undesirable states for not upholding the Dharma). The deep philosophical explanations, negations of conventional understanding, and the elaborate descriptions of the Buddha's nature confirm philosophical argumentation. The use of hyperbole and vivid descriptions of cosmic events (e.g., the samadhi illuminating '三千大千日月') demonstrates the presence of rhetoric.",

Its focus on the Bodhisattva path, the ten stages (十地), numerous Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and universal vows (""當願眾生"") firmly places it within Mahāyāna Buddhism. As a standalone sūtra not belonging to a specific major Mahāyāna collection, ""Collected Sūtras"" is the most appropriate Taishō genre. The text features extensive dialogue, with 智首菩薩 asking 敬首菩薩, and subsequently 法意菩薩 delivering the main discourse on the ten grounds. While it doesn't present a formal philosophical debate, it contains discussions and explanations of philosophical concepts such as emptiness (空), non-self (非身), and the illusory nature of phenomena (如化, 如夢, 如幻), qualifying it for philosophical argumentation. The frequent use of formulaic vows starting with ""當願眾生"" and descriptive praise indicates the presence of rhetoric. The text explicitly mentions the awareness of ""殃福之報"" (retribution for good and bad actions), indicating the presence of the concept of karmic retribution.",

Given its early translation by Zhiqian (吳月支優婆塞支謙譯) during the Wu kingdom (3rd century CE), and its narrative structure detailing the Buddha's encounter with a Brahmin, describing his characteristics (32 marks, 80 minor marks), and teachings on liberation, it aligns well with the themes found in early Buddhist texts often classified under 'Āgama'. While it doesn't belong to the four main Āgama collections, many independent early sutras in the Taisho canon are grouped there or under ""Collected Sūtras."" 'Āgama' is a good fit for its instructional dialogue and focus on the historical Buddha's persona and fundamental teachings. The text contains the phrase ""以四等大乘自度尊身又濟眾生"" (With the four immeasurables of the Great Vehicle, he saves himself and also saves sentient beings) (0884b18), which directly references ""Mahāyāna"" (大乘) and its characteristic emphasis on saving others. The mention of ""諸開士尊"" (revered Bodhisattvas) (0884c02) also points towards Mahāyāna. The text describes the Buddha performing several miracles, such as displaying the hidden physical marks (陰馬藏, 廣長舌) (0883c07, 0885b04-05), emitting light, and traveling miraculously from Suídí to Míyí. These acts are instrumental in convincing Fanmoyujing of the Buddha's divine nature and truth, qualifying it as a 'miracle_tale'. This is a sūtra, not a commentary or treatise. The text is structured around extensive conversations between the Buddha, Mōnāva, and Fanmoyujing, with Fanmoyujing posing questions in both prose and verse to the Buddha. The primary speaker of the dharma and the central figure in the dialogues is the Buddha. No dhāraṇī or mantra-like recitations were found in the text. The text features clear philosophical argumentation, such as the Buddha defining key Buddhist concepts (逝心, 通達, 清淨, 寂然, 佛) and explaining the ""essence of the supreme path"" (至道之要), which includes insights into suffering, the illusory nature of the three realms, and dependent origination (因緣合則禍生，諸緣離則苦滅). The text employs rich descriptive language and exclamations of praise for the Buddha's divine qualities, physical marks, and teachings, particularly in the accounts of Mōnāva and Fanmoyujing. Examples include ""神聖巍巍, 為如來、應儀..."" (0883b16) and ""巍巍乎其無上，洋洋乎其無崖"" (0884c09), which are rhetorical devices to elevate the Buddha's status. The text explains the Buddha's attainment of his perfect body and enlightenment as a result of accumulating merits over countless eons (""吾自無數劫來，行四等心...萬善積著遂成佛身""). It also states that believers in the Buddha will experience peace in this life and rebirth in heaven (""現世安隱終生天上"") and that Fanmoyujing achieves ""不還"" (non-returner) status and then ""應真無為"" (arhatship), which are direct results of his accumulated good karma and practice. The text mentions Śākyamuni Buddha (referred to as 佛, 沙門瞿曇, 世尊, and by his birth names 悉達), Fanmoyujing (梵摩渝), Mōnāva (摩納), Ānanda (阿難), King Suddhodana (白淨), and Queen Māyā (清妙). The text mentions various celestial beings and spirits that pay homage to the Buddha, including Indra (釋), Brahmā (梵), Devas (諸天), Nāgas (龍), Yakṣas/Bhūtas (鬼), and Bodhisattvas (諸開士尊). The narrative takes place in the Suídí Kingdom (隨提國) and Míyí Kingdom (彌夷國). The Kunlun River (崑崙河) is mentioned metaphorically. This text is a sūtra, not a commentary, so there are no text references.",

The Taishō genre 'Collected Sūtras' (經集) is chosen as it encompasses a broad range of Mahāyāna sūtras that focus on Bodhisattva practice and teachings without being specific to a single, named sūtra category like Prajñāpāramitā or Lotus. The central metaphor of the 'Bodhisattva Dao Tree' serves as a parable for the gradual development of the Bodhisattva path. The text contains philosophical argumentation concerning the nature of reality (e.g., non-self, non-existence), and uses rhetoric to praise the Buddha and inspire devotion. Karmic retribution is present through discussions of escaping lower realms (hell, animals, hungry ghosts) and purifying past misdeeds. The 'speaker' is identified as the Buddha as he is the primary expounder of the Dharma.",

It is primarily a dialogue between Śākyamuni Buddha and Ānanda, with a question from Ayita Bodhisattva. The section comparing the beauty and status of a beggar, king, Cakravartin, and various devas to the beings in Amitābha's Pure Land serves as an extended parable to illustrate the supreme qualities of the Pure Land. Karmic retribution is explicitly discussed in the context of the beggar's past actions and the conditions for rebirth in Amitābha's land. The language uses extensive descriptions and comparisons, indicating the presence of rhetoric.",
