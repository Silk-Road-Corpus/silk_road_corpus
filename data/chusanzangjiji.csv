Master Dao'an’s Catalog omits this scripture. The previous item is one part in a total of one fascicle. Emperor Xiaoming of Han had a dream of a golden man. The emissary Zhang Qian, accompanied by the Yu Lin [Palace Guards] commanded by General Qin Jing, to the Western Regions. When they arrived at Tokara met the monk Kasyapa-Matanga. He returned with them to Luoyang where he translated this scripture. It was stored in Room 40 of the Orchid Terrace. Today the scripture is in general circulation. [From Introduction T 2145, 55.0005b16] The ancient scriptures, as they are now [arranged], do not begin with [the Sūtra of] Forty-Two Sections, as supposed by the envoy Zhang Qian.

Funayama (2013, 22) states that this actually appeared in the early fifth century or later. Heng-ching (2017, 27-28) states that it is a compilation of ideas from many sūtras and that Mahayana and Daoist elements in the text may have been added at a later time. Nattier (2008, 35-36) notes that there are obvious problems with the historical accuracy of the preface. In particular, the figure Zhang Qian 張騫 mentioned in the preface as being dispatched by Emperor Xiaoming of Later Han was a well-known figure who actually lived in the secondary century BCE."

With regard to the sūtra mentioned previously, Jiang Mi, a scholar at the Imperial Academy in the late Qi dynasty, had an illegitimate daughter who became a nun. When she was a young child, she would sometimes close her eyes and sit in quiet meditation. During these times, she would recite this sūtra, claiming that it was from heaven or given to her by spirits. Her speech was fluent, as if from prior knowledge. She would instruct others to write it down, but then suddenly stop. After a period of ten days or a month, she would resume as before. The people of the capital, both religious and lay, widely spread rumors of her unusual abilities. The emperor at the time summoned her for an audience and asked for an explanation. She responded in a straightforward manner, not unlike a regular person, yet she was a devout believer in the true Dharma and had undertaken some religious practices. Her parents wanted to marry her off, but she adamantly refused. She later became a nun, taking the name Sengfa, and lived at the Qingyuan Temple. Since I am in the process of compiling and reviewing Buddhist texts and other unusual accounts, I have heard about this matter. I sought to examine her writings, but her family kept them secret and would not show them to me. I only managed to obtain the three-fascicle Sūtra on the Wonderful Sound of the Lion’s Roar, which I included in my collection of doubtful sutras. This nun died in the third month of the Tianjian era. There are some who, being curious, have obtained the written records of what she produced, both before and after this period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The second part of Sengyou's note about this item is located below 序七世經 (T 2145, 55.0040b06)."

The item above was produced in the ninth year of the Tianjian era [502-519] of the Liang dynasty, a nun from Yingzhou named Miaoguang claimed to have attained great spiritual wisdom, despite having only been ordained for seven years. Many nuns and laypeople declared her a saint. The Monastic Director of Yingzhou planned to expel her. Miaoguang secretly traveled to the capital and took residence at Puhong Temple. There, she created this scripture. She also copied the text onto a screen, draped it in red silk, and adorned it with incense and flowers. People from all four monastic groups gathered to make offerings, and the temple was filled with smoke from the incense. When her actions became widely known, an imperial decree ordered an investigation. The investigation revealed that she had plagiarized various other sūtra and had inserted her own ideas. It was also discovered that she had hired a scholar named Lu Yan to refine the language of the text. According to official court documents, Miaoguang’s cunning fraudulence warranted decapitation, and Lu Yan, as an accomplice, was to be exiled for ten years. On the 21st day of the fourth month of that same year, Emperor Wu of Liang commanded Monastic Director Huichao to summon twenty prominent and virtuous monks from the capital, including myself Sengyou and Tanzhun, to assemble at Jiankang to investigate Miaoguang’s case. Huichao complied with the imperial order and, along with Tanzhun, Sengyou, and eighteen other monks including Facong, Huiling, Huiji, Zhizang, Sengmin, and Fayun, questioned Miaoguang at the county office. Miaoguang confessed to her crimes, and the details matched the court documents. The monks decided, based on monastic law, to expel and punish her. The emperor spared her from the death penalty but, fearing that she might cause further deception elsewhere, ordered her to be imprisoned for life at the Eastern Prison. The authorities seized over twenty copies of the sutra and the screen, and they were all burned at the county office. However, some scattered copies still existed, so this record was made to prevent them from misleading future generations. (Note: Saporuotuo was Miaoguang’s father’s name, his younger brother’s name was Jingangdeti, and her disciple’s name was Shizi.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://dazangthings.nz/cbc/text/4324/,,,,,,,,,
2229,法苑經,5,4,Fa Yuan Jing,189,,,,,,,,法苑經,,,,"The two items above are collections from recent times. The dates and names of the authors are unknown. They bring together many sūtras and groups them by category. Once a title is established, a text like the ‘Fa Yuan’ is considered a separate scripture. Therefore, its name is annotated to show later scholars. Although the number of volumes is large, they are still just a collection of previously recorded sūtras. Thus, they are not included in the main section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sengyou's note is given after 抄為法捨身經 (T 2145, 55.0040c15)."
