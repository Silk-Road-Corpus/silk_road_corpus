It utilizes two main narrative elements—the worms in the pond and the hungry ghost bhikkhu—as parables to illustrate the severe karmic retribution for misusing monastic offerings and improper conduct regarding food purity. The strong warnings and vivid descriptions of suffering serve a rhetorical purpose to persuade listeners. It focuses on early Buddhist monastic ethics and lacks typical Mahayana doctrines, hence it is classified as non-Mahayana. The presence of these illustrative karmic tales aligns it with the Jātaka and Avadāna genre.",

It is an exposition of Buddhist principles and practices, fitting the description of a sutra.The text was translated by An Shigao, a renowned figure for early Buddhist translations, particularly those focused on meditation and Abhidharma. The content, which systematizes various Buddhist teachings on the path (如是行者，但當一切捨，使行道地從後來 - practitioners should abandon everything to follow the path-stages), is suitable for the 'Collected Sūtras' category. The text does not contain distinctly Mahāyāna doctrines such as universal salvation, the Trikāya, or a highly developed concept of śūnyatā as found in Prajñāpāramitā sūtras. It focuses on individual liberation through understanding suffering, impermanence, and non-self, consistent with early Buddhist teachings. The text utilizes numerous analogies and similes to clarify complex teachings, such as comparing the body to various decaying objects, or the process of seeking fire from wood to the practice of meditation. These are primarily explanatory rather than miraculous tales of salvation. The text is a primary discourse, not a commentary on another work, nor an Abhidharma treatise in the scholastic sense. The text is presented as a continuous teaching, primarily by the Buddha, rather than an interactive dialogue between multiple parties. While rhetorical questions are posed, the answers are immediately supplied by the speaker. The Buddha is clearly identified as the speaker (e.g., ""佛言"" - The Buddha said). No dharanis (mystical incantations) are found within the text. The text extensively uses logical reasoning to explain the nature of existence, the aggregates, and the path to liberation. For example, the detailed breakdown of the body's formation and decay serves as a philosophical argument for impermanence and suffering. The text employs persuasive language, vivid imagery, and numerous analogies to emphasize its teachings and evoke understanding and conviction in the reader. This includes graphic descriptions of the body's impurity, illness, and death. Chapter 5 explicitly describes how actions lead to specific rebirths in different realms (heaven, human, animal, hungry ghost, hell), directly addressing the concept of karmic retribution. The text does not mention any specific historical individuals by name within its narrative. The text mentions ",0,False,,,False,,False,False,False,False,[],[],[],[],,

The text is structured as a detailed dialogue between the Buddha and Ananda, with the Buddha systematically deconstructing concepts of self and suffering through a series of logical inquiries and rhetorical questions, which demonstrates philosophical argumentation and rhetoric.

The content focuses on fundamental Buddhist teachings without incorporating distinct Mahāyāna concepts like emptiness (śūnyatā) in its Mahāyāna sense, the bodhisattva path, or Trikāya doctrine.

There are no distinct Mahāyāna doctrines such as the Bodhisattva path, extensive emptiness teachings, or elaborate cosmological elements. The text contains structured lists of practices, obstacles, and insights (e.g., 'twelve assemblies', 'twenty items to explain', 'sixteen practices to hear the Dharma', 'ten thoughts', 'fourteen evil dharmas', 'twenty things that hinder the path', 'twenty things that quicken the mind') which constitutes philosophical argumentation regarding the Buddhist path and significant rhetoric for instruction. Karmic retribution is explicitly mentioned: 'Each obtains from their actions, each from the root of their actions, each receives suffering from their actions, each performs good and evil, and receives according to their actions'.

The highly repetitive phrasing, particularly for the five aspects of each concept (e.g., ""當知X，亦當知X從本有，亦當知從X受殃，亦當知X分布，亦當知X盡，亦當知受何行令X畢""), serves as a rhetorical device for emphasis and memorization.

He uses rhetorical questions to guide the Bodhisattvas to self-reflection and deeper understanding. The analogy of the 'licentious jealous woman' serves as a parable to illustrate the consequences of unacknowledged defilements and pain, thereby implying karmic retribution.

It uses rhetorical devices such as repetitive questions and exclamations to emphasize key points. A significant portion of the text discusses severe karmic retribution for those who slander or reject the deep Prajñāpāramitā teachings, including descriptions of suffering in hells. No specific earthly places are mentioned, only cosmic realms like various heavens and Buddha-fields. No dhāraṇīs or explicit parables/miracle tales are present.",

It contains significant philosophical argumentation, particularly regarding emptiness (空) and non-attainment (無所得), and employs extensive rhetoric to emphasize the merits of practicing Prajñāpāramitā. Karmic retribution is present in discussions of the consequences of actions like pride and quarreling, and the benefits of supporting bodhisattvas.

It features extensive dialogues primarily between the Buddha and his disciples Ānanda and Subhūti. The story of Sadhāparibhūta Bodhisattva's arduous quest for Prajñāpāramitā, involving self-sacrifice and divine intervention (like Indra's test and the apparition of a Buddha), classifies it as a miracle tale. The text extensively uses philosophical argumentation regarding emptiness (空), non-origination, and the nature of phenomena, and employs rhetoric through persuasive language and analogies to emphasize the importance of Prajñāpāramitā. The narrative of Sadhāparibhūta highlights the accumulation of merit from past lives (karmic causes and conditions). No explicit dhāraṇī is found. Deities include Buddhas other than Śākyamuni, bodhisattvas like Dharmodgata and Sadhāparibhūta, and other supernatural beings like Indra and Maara. Historical people listed are the Buddha's direct disciples.",

It is classified under 'Collected Sūtras' as it is a specific Mahāyāna sūtra not belonging to the larger, named Mahāyāna collections. Its Mahāyāna nature is evident through the presence of Bodhisattvas, the aspiration for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, and the visualization of innumerable Buddhas. The text features several narratives, including the extensive exposition of immense merits in Chapter 13 and stories of past lives and encounters with Buddhas in Chapters 14 and 15, all serving as parables to illustrate profound teachings and the benefits of practicing the samadhi. The account of Buddha's spiritual power making Bhadrapala's house vast and transparent (Chapter 10) also contains elements of a miracle tale. The text lacks an explicit dhāraṇī. Philosophical argumentation is present in discussions of concepts like emptiness, non-attachment, non-arising, and the nature of the 'Buddha Seal'. Rhetorical devices are used, such as gathas (verses), grand comparisons for merit, and persuasive language. The narratives of past lives and the attainment of Buddhahood or auspicious rebirths due to practicing or supporting the samadhi illustrate positive karmic causes and conditions.

It is classified as Mahayana due to its central focus on the Bodhisattva path, the emphasis on emptiness (空), great compassion (大慈), and its explicit comparisons and contrasts between the Bodhisattva path and the paths of Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas. The Taishō genre 'Collected Sūtras' (經集) is chosen because it is a Mahayana sūtra that doesn't fit into the more specific major Mahayana sūtra categories like Prajñāpāramitā or Lotus, but rather presents a compilation of teachings on various aspects of the Bodhisattva path and wisdom. The text contains numerous similes and analogies, often introduced by '譬如', serving as parables to explain complex Buddhist concepts. Philosophical argumentation is evident in discussions concerning emptiness, non-self, the nature of mind, and the correct understanding of precepts, often through a dialectical or negational approach. Rhetoric is present through the use of persuasive language, rhetorical questions, and the structured 'four things' (四事) lists that categorize virtues and faults. Karmic retribution is discussed in relation to actions leading to the loss or gain of Bodhisattva intent and the consequences of past deeds. The text is structured as a dialogue, primarily between the Buddha and Mahākāśyapa, and later involving Subhūti and a group of 500 monks. No dhāraṇīs or explicit references to other texts are found within the sūtra's body.",

The narratives of salvation for King Ajātaśatru and others through understanding the Dharma, along with Mañjuśrī's supernatural abilities, qualify as 'miracle_tale'. The text is extensively presented in dialogue format. The Buddha is identified as the primary speaker, as indicated by the title 'Buddha Speaks' and his ultimate authority within the text. The text explicitly contains a dhāraṇī taught by Mañjuśrī. It features extensive philosophical argumentation on topics such as emptiness, non-duality, and the nature of mind. Rhetorical devices such as similes and analogies are frequently used. The central theme of King Ajātaśatru's parricide and subsequent liberation through the Dharma directly addresses karmic retribution. Historical figures like King Ajātaśatru, Mahākāśyapa, Śāriputra, Ānanda, Śākyamuni Buddha, and others are mentioned. Deities include various Bodhisattvas (Mañjuśrī, Maitreya, etc.), Deva kings, Yakṣas, Brahmā, and Nāga kings. Specific places like Rājagṛha, Jambudvīpa, and various heavenly and hell realms are named.

It is Mahāyāna because of the prominent role of Bodhisattvas, the concept of multiple Buddha-fields, and the expansive cosmology. The text has dialogic elements, as Bodhisattvas express their thoughts and requests, and Mañjuśrī speaks, with the Buddha responding through a display of light and power.

It is Mahāyāna due to its emphasis on Bodhisattva practice (e.g., the Six Perfections, extensive vows by the 500 companions), the aspiration for unexcelled, solitary, revered, equal, correct enlightenment (無上獨尊平等覺意), and the teachings on emptiness (空無, 空見). The miraculous events surrounding the meal and the Buddha's powers, as well as the later display of great magical feats by Bodhisattva Dali Puming, qualify it as containing 'miracle_tale' elements.

Karmic retribution is explicitly discussed, with references to '宿罪所牽' (being pulled by past karma) and the '殃福之應' (retribution of blessings and misfortunes).

The dialogue format, especially with Śāriputra and Mañjuśrī, is characteristic of this genre. The narrative about King Hui Shang (慧上), who is revealed to be Amitābha Buddha in a past life, and his 1000 sons becoming future Buddhas, functions as a parable illustrating the immense merits and transformative power of practicing this specific samādhi.

The deep philosophical explanations, negations of conventional understanding, and the elaborate descriptions of the Buddha's nature confirm philosophical argumentation. The use of hyperbole and vivid descriptions of cosmic events (e.g., the samadhi illuminating '三千大千日月') demonstrates the presence of rhetoric.",

Its focus on the Bodhisattva path, the ten stages (十地), numerous Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and universal vows (""當願眾生"") firmly places it within Mahāyāna Buddhism. As a standalone sūtra not belonging to a specific major Mahāyāna collection, ""Collected Sūtras"" is the most appropriate Taishō genre. The text features extensive dialogue, with 智首菩薩 asking 敬首菩薩, and subsequently 法意菩薩 delivering the main discourse on the ten grounds. While it doesn't present a formal philosophical debate, it contains discussions and explanations of philosophical concepts such as emptiness (空), non-self (非身), and the illusory nature of phenomena (如化, 如夢, 如幻), qualifying it for philosophical argumentation. The frequent use of formulaic vows starting with ""當願眾生"" and descriptive praise indicates the presence of rhetoric. The text explicitly mentions the awareness of ""殃福之報"" (retribution for good and bad actions), indicating the presence of the concept of karmic retribution.",

Given its early translation by Zhiqian (吳月支優婆塞支謙譯) during the Wu kingdom (3rd century CE), and its narrative structure detailing the Buddha's encounter with a Brahmin, describing his characteristics (32 marks, 80 minor marks), and teachings on liberation, it aligns well with the themes found in early Buddhist texts often classified under 'Āgama'. While it doesn't belong to the four main Āgama collections, many independent early sutras in the Taisho canon are grouped there or under ""Collected Sūtras."" 'Āgama' is a good fit for its instructional dialogue and focus on the historical Buddha's persona and fundamental teachings. The text contains the phrase ""以四等大乘自度尊身又濟眾生"" (With the four immeasurables of the Great Vehicle, he saves himself and also saves sentient beings) (0884b18), which directly references ""Mahāyāna"" (大乘) and its characteristic emphasis on saving others. The mention of ""諸開士尊"" (revered Bodhisattvas) (0884c02) also points towards Mahāyāna. The text describes the Buddha performing several miracles, such as displaying the hidden physical marks (陰馬藏, 廣長舌) (0883c07, 0885b04-05), emitting light, and traveling miraculously from Suídí to Míyí. These acts are instrumental in convincing Fanmoyujing of the Buddha's divine nature and truth, qualifying it as a 'miracle_tale'. This is a sūtra, not a commentary or treatise. The text is structured around extensive conversations between the Buddha, Mōnāva, and Fanmoyujing, with Fanmoyujing posing questions in both prose and verse to the Buddha. The primary speaker of the dharma and the central figure in the dialogues is the Buddha. No dhāraṇī or mantra-like recitations were found in the text. The text features clear philosophical argumentation, such as the Buddha defining key Buddhist concepts (逝心, 通達, 清淨, 寂然, 佛) and explaining the ""essence of the supreme path"" (至道之要), which includes insights into suffering, the illusory nature of the three realms, and dependent origination (因緣合則禍生，諸緣離則苦滅). The text employs rich descriptive language and exclamations of praise for the Buddha's divine qualities, physical marks, and teachings, particularly in the accounts of Mōnāva and Fanmoyujing. Examples include ""神聖巍巍, 為如來、應儀..."" (0883b16) and ""巍巍乎其無上，洋洋乎其無崖"" (0884c09), which are rhetorical devices to elevate the Buddha's status. The text explains the Buddha's attainment of his perfect body and enlightenment as a result of accumulating merits over countless eons (""吾自無數劫來，行四等心...萬善積著遂成佛身""). It also states that believers in the Buddha will experience peace in this life and rebirth in heaven (""現世安隱終生天上"") and that Fanmoyujing achieves ""不還"" (non-returner) status and then ""應真無為"" (arhatship), which are direct results of his accumulated good karma and practice. The text mentions Śākyamuni Buddha (referred to as 佛, 沙門瞿曇, 世尊, and by his birth names 悉達), Fanmoyujing (梵摩渝), Mōnāva (摩納), Ānanda (阿難), King Suddhodana (白淨), and Queen Māyā (清妙). The text mentions various celestial beings and spirits that pay homage to the Buddha, including Indra (釋), Brahmā (梵), Devas (諸天), Nāgas (龍), Yakṣas/Bhūtas (鬼), and Bodhisattvas (諸開士尊). The narrative takes place in the Suídí Kingdom (隨提國) and Míyí Kingdom (彌夷國). The Kunlun River (崑崙河) is mentioned metaphorically. This text is a sūtra, not a commentary, so there are no text references.",

The Taishō genre 'Collected Sūtras' (經集) is chosen as it encompasses a broad range of Mahāyāna sūtras that focus on Bodhisattva practice and teachings without being specific to a single, named sūtra category like Prajñāpāramitā or Lotus. The central metaphor of the 'Bodhisattva Dao Tree' serves as a parable for the gradual development of the Bodhisattva path. The text contains philosophical argumentation concerning the nature of reality (e.g., non-self, non-existence), and uses rhetoric to praise the Buddha and inspire devotion. Karmic retribution is present through discussions of escaping lower realms (hell, animals, hungry ghosts) and purifying past misdeeds. The 'speaker' is identified as the Buddha as he is the primary expounder of the Dharma.",

It is primarily a dialogue between Śākyamuni Buddha and Ānanda, with a question from Ayita Bodhisattva. The section comparing the beauty and status of a beggar, king, Cakravartin, and various devas to the beings in Amitābha's Pure Land serves as an extended parable to illustrate the supreme qualities of the Pure Land. Karmic retribution is explicitly discussed in the context of the beggar's past actions and the conditions for rebirth in Amitābha's land.
