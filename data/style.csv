The 'syllables_per_line' refers to the common length of short clauses, with 4 characters (syllables) being a frequently observed unit, though sentence and clause lengths are highly variable as is typical for prose. The style reflects characteristics of early Chinese Buddhist translations from Indic languages, aiming for directness over ornate elegance. The consistent use of direct address, repetition for emphasis, and formulaic phrases suggests an oral transmission context for the source text, which is faithfully rendered in the translation. The spiritual content is purely Buddhist without apparent indigenous Chinese philosophical interpretations. Tense is indicated through temporal adverbs and context rather than explicit grammatical markers.",

It is a systematic enumeration and definition of Buddhist doctrines (e.g., five skandhas, six sense bases, twelve sense fields, dependent origination, thirty-seven factors of awakening, four noble truths, and various defilements and insights). The style is highly repetitive, using formulaic phrases such as 'X 為何等？...是為X' (What are these X? ... these are X). This repetitiveness and directness are strong indicators of a literal translation attempting to convey the structure of the source text. The language is plain and unadorned, focusing on precise classification rather than ornate expression. While individual statements are concise, the exhaustive nature of the enumerations makes the overall presentation verbose. The terminology used is analytical and descriptive, aligning with a factual tone for explaining spiritual concepts. There is no evidence of reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophies or the use of Chinese idioms. Sentence subjects are often implicit. The character 諸 (zhū) is not used as a pluralizer. Tense is generally unspecified, relying on context or aspectual markers like '已' for completed actions.",

Many chapter openings and lists (e.g., 'five qualities' chapter) exhibit rhythmic patterns, though syllable counts per line vary, with typical lines often around 5-8 characters. The translation style is generally archaic and reflects Indic syntax, making it less fluid than later translations. It is not strictly vernacular but lacks the polish of high literary Chinese. An Shigao's verbose nature in explaining concepts is evident through extensive descriptions and sometimes repetitive phrasing. The focus is on direct transmission of Buddhist teachings, without significant interpretation through indigenous Chinese concepts or the use of Chinese idioms. There is no interlinear commentary or abbreviations. Signs of oral transmission, such as repetition and a somewhat disjointed flow, are present.

It avoids indigenous Chinese philosophical interpretations and traditional Chinese idioms. Tense is largely unspecified, relying on context. Sentence subjects are often implicit. The adverb 諸 (zhu) is used for plural or collective indication (e.g., 'all desires'). Its verbose nature stems from the exhaustive listing and reiteration of concepts, which may also be a characteristic retained from the original Indic oral tradition.

This results in direct, sometimes grammatically awkward phrasing from a classical Chinese perspective. The language is plain and repetitive, serving as a systematic enumeration of Buddhist doctrines and practices (the 'ten dharmas' and their sub-divisions). The frequent use of structured lists and repetitive introductory/concluding phrases points strongly to mnemonic devices common in oral transmission traditions. While the content is primarily spiritual, it is presented in a very systematic, almost catalogue-like manner. Subjects are often explicitly stated, a characteristic of early, literal translations from Indic languages, although typical Chinese implicit subjects still appear.",

The text is written in prose with frequent, extensive numbered lists. The language is direct and often preserves the grammatical structure of the original, leading to repetitive phrasing (e.g., '上頭亦善，中央亦善，要亦善') and sometimes less fluid Chinese. This directness contributes to a 'plain' language style, devoid of ornate literary devices. While individual clauses can be short, the pervasive repetition and numerous long enumerations make the overall wording verbose. The usage of 'vernacular' refers to a simplified, direct style that is not highly literary or classically refined, rather than contemporary colloquial speech. There are no identifiable Chinese idioms or interpretations based on indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. Signs of oral transmission are evident through formulaic repetitions, the direct address '賢者！', and the structure of enumerated points. Tense is indicated explicitly through temporal particles and adverbs like '當' (dang) for future/obligation and '已' (yi) for completed actions.

This repetition, combined with the often direct, almost word-for-word rendering, can make the Chinese feel somewhat stiff or awkward compared to later, more sinicized translations. The language is very direct and unadorned, focusing on clear enumeration and explanation of Buddhist concepts. The style is highly indicative of oral transmission, with phrases repeated verbatim multiple times throughout the discourse, making it suitable for memorization and recitation. While discussing spiritual topics, the approach is analytical and categorical, defining and classifying phenomena such as 'defilements' (漏) and 'feelings' (痛) in a systematic manner rather than using highly evocative or mystical language. The use of '諸' for pluralization (e.g., '諸比丘') is consistent, and tense is generally unspecified, relying on context or auxiliary verbs like '當' (should/will) for future/imperative.",

The language is plain and direct, focusing on systematically explaining the Four Noble Truths. There are clear signs of oral transmission due to formulaic openings ('聞如是', '一時') and extensive repetition, likely aiding memorization and delivery.

It employs a mixed style, combining lengthy prose explanations with shorter, gāthā-like verse sections, often marked by '佛從後說絕'. The language is notably literal, resulting in awkward or redundant phrasing in Chinese, and prioritizes direct semantic transfer over fluent or literary Chinese style. This contributes to a plain, rather than ornate, linguistic presentation. Despite the simplicity of individual sentences, the frequent repetition of concepts and exhaustive enumeration of points make the overall exposition verbose. No indigenous Chinese idioms or significant abbreviations are observed. While the content is spiritual, the presentation is systematic and descriptive, leaning towards a factual tone, and generally avoids reinterpreting Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks. The text frequently uses explicit sentence subjects and the plural marker 諸 (zhu). Tense is largely unspecified, inferred from context. The consistent '聞如是' opening, conversational format, and repetitive structures suggest an origin in oral transmission.

The language is plain, didactic, and focuses on practical advice for avoiding untimely death rather than deep spiritual teachings. The repetitive structure and clear explanations suggest an influence or characteristic of oral transmission.

The Chinese translation itself employs a plain and vernacular language, prioritizing direct conveyance of meaning over literary elegance, characteristic of early Chinese Buddhist translations. No indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts are used for interpretation. The concluding meta-commentary about textual variants (referencing '丹藏', '宋、鄉二本', and '明度經') highlights early philological efforts in preserving and standardizing Buddhist texts, rather than indicating interpolations within the provided main text.",

The text contains numerous repetitions, direct addresses, and formulaic phrases, strongly suggesting an influence from oral transmission. Buddhist technical terms are predominantly transliterated (e.g., 般若波羅蜜, 薩芸若, 三昧), conveying a spiritual rather than purely factual tone. The character 諸 (zhū) is extensively used to indicate plural forms.

The translation style is notably literal, often reflecting Indic syntax directly and using multiple Chinese characters or terms to render a single Sanskrit concept, contributing to its verbose nature. The frequent use of terms like '慈孝' (filial piety/compassion and filial devotion) demonstrates an interpretation of Buddhist virtues through indigenous Chinese cultural values. The text exhibits characteristics of oral transmission, such as direct address to specific individuals (e.g., Ananda, Sathapala Bodhisattva), rhetorical questions, and exclamations ('善哉，善哉!'). Sentence subjects are often explicitly stated, a trait influenced by the Indic source language.

This mixed style is typical of many Indic Buddhist sutras. The verse sections primarily employ 7-syllable lines, with some instances of 5-syllable lines; 7 is chosen as the dominant form. This structure reflects efforts to fit the original rhythm into Chinese meter. The translation uses a relatively direct and simple vocabulary, characteristic of early Han dynasty translations by Lokakṣema, which tended towards a more accessible, less ornate style compared to later, more literary translations. While not modern vernacular, its directness and lack of classical allusions place it closer to ""vernacular"" than ""literary"" in the context of classical Chinese stylistic spectrum. Lokakṣema's translations are known for their extreme literalness, often reproducing the syntax and word order of the Indic source language. This results in a somewhat stiff or repetitive Chinese but prioritizes fidelity to the original structure. The language is plain and unadorned, largely avoiding literary embellishments or sophisticated rhetoric, a consequence of the literal translation approach. The translation is verbose, characterized by extensive repetition of phrases, detailed enumerations, and explanations. This reflects the style of the original Indic source, which often used repetition for emphasis and mnemonic purposes, and the translator's literal approach. Few, if any, indigenous Chinese idioms are used; the translation directly renders the source, rather than adapting expressions into Chinese idioms. The text frequently uses transliterated Sanskrit terms like ""三昧"" (samādhi) for meditative states, rather than purely factual Chinese terms. The overall subject matter is concerned with spiritual attainments and the visualization of Buddhas, indicating a spiritual tone. There is no overt evidence of systematic reinterpretation of Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts in this early translation; the translation style focuses on direct rendering. No clear interpolations were identified within the main discourse. The title's alternative name might be a descriptive addition but not an internal textual interpolation. No interlinear commentary is present in the provided text. The frequent repetitions of phrases and formulaic introductions (e.g., ""前為佛作禮，却坐一面"") are strong indicators that the source text was deeply influenced by oral transmission practices. The translation style preserves these characteristics. No abbreviations of Chinese characters or terms are used. The translation often allows for implicit subjects, typical of classical Chinese, especially when the subject is clear from context or remains the same across clauses; it does not consistently make subjects explicit. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is frequently used to indicate plural forms, such as ""諸佛,"" ""諸菩薩,"" ""諸比丘,"" etc. Tense is largely unspecified in the Chinese translation, as is characteristic of classical Chinese grammar, relying on context or temporal adverbs rather than explicit verbal markings.",

A notable feature is the presence of 'Geyi' (concept-matching), where Buddhist concepts are occasionally rendered using indigenous Chinese philosophical terms (e.g., '能儒', '昇仙', '儒林'). The verse sections consistently employ a four-syllable line structure. The particle '諸' is frequently used to indicate plural forms.

The prose sections are descriptive narratives and dialogues. The verse sections (gathas), such as when Brahmana Fanmoyou questions the Buddha, consistently feature five syllables per line. The language leans towards a formal, literary style characteristic of early Buddhist translations, not fully vernacular but also not purely classical in its native Chinese composition. It is quite literal, often directly translating Indic structures and concepts, which can sometimes result in slightly less fluid Chinese phrasing (e.g., long lists of attributes). The language is generally plain rather than ornate. The translation is verbose, providing extensive details and lists, such as the thirty-two marks of a great man and the eight kinds of sound. There are no readily apparent Chinese idioms (成語). The tone is highly spiritual, emphasizing the Buddha's divine qualities, enlightenment, and profound teachings, using honorific titles like '如來' (Tathagata) and '天中天' (God among gods). Buddhist concepts are occasionally interpreted with indigenous Chinese philosophical terms, such as '仙' (immortal) and '無為' (non-action, a Daoist concept), indicating some syncretic influence or an effort to relate new ideas to existing frameworks. The text does not contain interlinear commentary or obvious interpolations beyond what might be typical explanatory additions in early translations. Signs of oral transmission are present, notably '聞如是' (Thus have I heard), and the text's didactic, narrative, and dialogue-driven structure. Abbreviations are not used. Sentence subjects are frequently explicit, which is common in more literal translations from Indic languages, contrasting with the often implicit subjects in native classical Chinese. The plural marker '諸' (zhū) is widely used (e.g., '諸佛', '諸天').

The language is plain, prioritizing direct conveyance of meaning over ornate embellishment. The style is somewhat verbose due to frequent repetitions, formulaic phrases (e.g., call-and-response, enumerations like '何等六？一者...是為六。'), and comprehensive listings, which also suggest signs of oral transmission and mnemonic aids. No distinctly Chinese idioms are used. The overall tone is spiritual, focusing on Buddhist doctrines, the Bodhisattva path, and spiritual attainments, rather than a purely factual presentation.

The translation style is quite literal, often adhering closely to the Indic source's syntax, which can sometimes make the Chinese sound less fluent. The presence of '漢言' (Chinese explanation) glosses for transliterated terms (e.g., '栴羅法(漢言月明)') further indicates a literal approach, serving as both interlinear commentary and interpolations.

The language is 'literary' in that it is not colloquial Chinese, but it often exhibits a 'translationese' style, showing direct renderings of Indic sentence structures, which can sometimes appear awkward compared to refined classical Chinese. There are strong indications of oral transmission, such as formulaic phrases ('聞如是', '佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園', '比丘歡喜') and recurring introductory and concluding sentences for verse sections (e.g., '為後世學作明，令我經道久住'). These recurring statements about the text's purpose for future generations also suggest interpolations or translator's additions to contextualize the text for a Chinese audience.

It uses formal literary Chinese, employs explicit sentence subjects more often than fluent classical Chinese might, and frequently uses '諸' for plurals.

The number '4' for syllables per line is an approximation for such structured phrases. Zhi Qian's translation style is characteristic of his period, aiming for a more fluent and relatively plain Chinese, moving away from overly literal or archaic translations. The consistent use of transliterated Sanskrit terms (e.g., 羅漢, 菩薩, 婆羅門, 三藐三菩提) reinforces a spiritual tone rather than a purely factual one and indicates a move away from strong indigenous Chinese philosophical interpretations.

No obvious modern idioms are used. The overall tone is spiritual, focusing on Buddhist doctrines of karma, suffering, and liberation, despite vivid descriptions of consequences. The inclusion of '奉孝' (upholding filial piety) in the five precepts for lay followers is a clear example of indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts influencing the interpretation, as filial piety is a key Confucian virtue.

The tone is distinctly spiritual, focusing on Buddhist doctrines and practices, although specific technical terms for meditation (定, samādhi) are used without always distinguishing a 'factual' versus 'spiritual' nuance. A significant aspect of this early translation is the clear integration of indigenous Chinese philosophical and ethical concepts, such as '仁' (benevolence), '孝' (filial piety), and the Confucian idea of a virtuous ruler's impact on the state's prosperity. This suggests an early attempt to make Buddhist teachings relatable to the Chinese worldview. Interpolations are likely present, as was common in early translations to clarify foreign concepts for a Chinese audience, especially in moralizing aspects that align with Chinese virtues. There is no interlinear commentary. Signs of oral transmission are evident, particularly in the formulaic opening '聞如是' (Thus have I heard) and the repetitive refrain '菩薩慈惠度無極行布施如是' at the end of each story, which aids memorization and emphasizes the theme.

The language is formal and tends towards the ornate, particularly in descriptions of Buddha-fields and the extensive use of synonyms. It is verbose due to repetition and comprehensive listing of terms. Chinese idioms are not prominently featured.

While the narrative itself can be extensive and include long lists (e.g., 64 scripts), the individual sentence structures and wording are often terse and concise. The translation shows minimal use of indigenous Chinese idioms, opting instead for a more direct, word-for-word rendering of the source material. The text's primary focus is on the spiritual journey of the Bodhisattva, including his meditative states (using terms like 三昧 samādhi) and miraculous deeds, making its tone overtly spiritual.

The text is written in a sophisticated form of classical Chinese, employing an elevated vocabulary and complex grammatical structures characteristic of literary prose of the Western Jin period, rather than colloquial speech. Dharmarakṣa's translations are known for their fluency, prioritizing readability and adapting the text to Chinese literary conventions. The sentences flow naturally in Chinese, indicating a less literal, more interpretive approach to the source material. The language tends towards the ornate, utilizing rich descriptions and carefully chosen vocabulary to enhance the narrative and convey spiritual concepts. It is not overly simple or stark. The translation exhibits a verbose style, with detailed narratives, frequent elaborations, and repetitions, which contributes to its readability but makes it less terse. Several Chinese idioms and idiomatic expressions are integrated, such as ""棄家牢獄，鋃鐺杻械"" (abandoning the home like a prison, with shackles and fetters), ""竭生死海"" (exhaust the ocean of samsara), ""心懷湯火"" (heart holding boiling water and fire), and ""舉手欲擲日月"" (raising a hand to throw at the sun and moon). The overarching tone is spiritual and didactic, focusing on Buddhist teachings, moral lessons, karma, and the path to enlightenment. Terms related to spiritual practice and liberation are used. Dharmarakṣa was known for his efforts to make Buddhist teachings accessible to Chinese audiences. While explicit philosophical reinterpretations are subtle in this excerpt, the narrative presentation of moral lessons and virtues aligns with traditional Chinese ethical sensibilities, and certain phrases like ""聖體萬福"" (sacred body, ten thousand blessings) reflect Chinese cultural integration. Given Dharmarakṣa's fluent and adaptive translation style, and the general practice of early Chinese Buddhist translators, it is highly probable that the text includes interpolations to clarify or expand upon the original Indic material for a Chinese readership. This inference is based on the stylistic characteristics rather than a direct comparison to an extant Sanskrit text. No interlinear commentary is present within the provided text. The text displays features consistent with oral transmission, such as the formulaic opening ""聞如是"" (Thus have I heard), repetitive narrative elements, and a clear, didactic storytelling style found in many early Buddhist narratives intended for spoken delivery.

Tense is generally unspecified, inferred from context or temporal indicators. The presence of formulaic phrases (e.g., '聞如是') and narrative structures suggests a background in oral transmission. The use of 諸 (zhu) for pluralization is frequent. While direct evidence of interpolations is not explicitly marked in the text, it is common for early Chinese Buddhist translations to contain such additions due to the nature of their transmission and translation process.",

The translation often adheres closely to the Indic source, at times translating literally, which can result in somewhat stiff or unfamiliar Chinese phrasing (e.g., ""聞如是"" for evaṃ mayā śrutam, and the question-and-answer format ""何謂... 曰...""). The language is functional and direct, focusing on conveying the doctrine clearly rather than employing extensive literary embellishment. Descriptions, while sometimes grand in subject matter, are rendered in plain terms. The text can be verbose due to extensive enumerations of qualities and practices (e.g., ""ten virtues,"" ""four laws,"" etc.), which is characteristic of Indic sutra style directly translated.

This is evident in repetitive phrasing, direct word-for-word translation of complex Buddhist terms (e.g., '柔順法忍' for anūtpattika-dharma-kṣānti), and occasional awkward syntax when directly mapping Indic grammar onto Chinese, as well as repetitive listing structures. The language is primarily plain and direct, focused on conveying complex doctrinal meaning, rather than employing extensive literary embellishments or highly poetic descriptions, outside of the inherent reverence in Buddhist terminology. The text leans towards verbosity due to the literal translation style, extended explanations of concepts, enumerations, and rhetorical questions, characteristic of expository Buddhist discourse. The text does not integrate pre-existing Chinese secular idioms. Its language is structured around directly translating or transliterating Buddhist concepts into Chinese. The discourse is deeply spiritual, employing numerous Buddhist technical terms (e.g., samādhi, bodhisattva, nirvana, bodhicitta) to explain profound doctrines and the path to enlightenment. The translation by Dharmarakṣa (竺法護) is generally considered to be more literal, and while it uses some Chinese philosophical terms (e.g., '無為', '道'), these are integrated into a distinctly Buddhist doctrinal framework without reinterpreting the core teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical lenses.

The text is verbose, especially in its dialogues and explanations, with frequent repetitions and detailed elaborations, often marked by phrases like '所以者何？' (Why is that so?). No traditional Chinese idioms (成語) are used. The tone is distinctly spiritual, deeply engaged with Buddhist philosophical concepts such as samādhi (三昧), emptiness, and enlightenment. While the translation was made during a period when 'Ge Yi' (matching Buddhist concepts with indigenous Chinese philosophical terms) was practiced, this particular text does not overtly interpret Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts; instead, it tends to establish its own Buddhist lexicon or use transliterations. There are no signs of interlinear commentary or overt large-scale interpolations that would significantly alter the narrative flow from a presumed source. However, there are clear signs of oral transmission, such as formulaic repetitions in dialogue, direct address to the audience (e.g., '天子當知', '文殊當知'), and exclamations like '善哉，善哉！'. Abbreviations in a non-standard or cryptic sense are not present. Sentence subjects are frequently implicit, relying on context to determine the agent of an action. The character '諸' (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plural forms (e.g., '諸佛', '諸菩薩'). Tense is generally left unspecified, inferred from context and temporal adverbs rather than explicit grammatical markers.",
等集眾德三昧經,T 381 (1),mixed,4,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,implicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The text is predominantly prose, with two short verse sections (gathas) that exhibit a relatively consistent 4-character line structure, common in early Buddhist verse translations, though with some minor variations. The predominant syllable count in the verse sections is 4, but there are lines with 3 or 5 syllables. The language leans towards literary Chinese, using formal vocabulary and sentence structures, but it is not purely classical in its composition, often reflecting the Indic source structure. Dharmarakṣa's style is generally literal, leading to repetitions and extensive enumerations that mirror the Sanskrit original's structure, which can make the Chinese less smooth at times. The language is plain, focusing on direct conveyance of meaning. The text is verbose due to numerous lengthy enumerations, detailed explanations, and repetitive phrasing, characteristic of an instruction or sutra format. No overt use of 'geyi' (matching Buddhist concepts with indigenous Chinese terms like Daoist or Confucian ones) is observed; Buddhist concepts are presented directly. There are parenthetical glosses for names (e.g., '[晉名鉤瑣力士]') which provide explanatory information, but they are not strictly 'interlinear' in formatting. The text begins with '聞如是' (Thus have I heard), a standard opening for sutras indicating oral transmission. Repetitions of phrases like '善哉，善哉！諦聽，諦聽！' and extensive enumerations also suggest an origin in an oral tradition. Subjects are frequently omitted when clear from context, which is typical of classical Chinese, making them implicit rather than consistently explicit.

The translation style is generally literal, often reflecting the grammatical structures and repetitive phrasing of the Sanskrit source, which sometimes results in less fluent or verbose Chinese. For instance, the frequent use of multiple synonymous or near-synonymous terms (e.g., ""無央數劫不可稱限，廣普無量不可思議"") suggests an effort to fully capture the nuances of the original concepts, making the language verbose rather than terse. While the text is formal and employs specific Buddhist terminology, leaning towards literary Chinese, its primary focus is on conveying doctrine in plain language, not ornate embellishment. The presence of direct address (e.g., ""族姓子！"", ""鉤鎖！""), question-and-answer formats, and repetitive structures points to the influence of oral transmission. Sentence subjects are often explicitly stated, more so than typically seen in classical Chinese, likely mirroring the more explicit subject usage in Indic languages. The use of '諸' (zhu) to denote plurality is common (e.g., ""諸佛"", ""諸眾生""). Tense is largely unspecified and inferred from context, a common feature of classical Chinese. Buddhist teachings are presented as direct translations without significant reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts.

The translation exhibits features of a literal rendering from an Indic language, such as frequent repetition of clauses and somewhat rigid syntax, which can sometimes make the Chinese less natural. The language, while classical, is primarily focused on conveying complex Buddhist doctrines directly, rather than using extensive literary embellishments or flowery descriptions. While Classical Chinese often permits implicit subjects, this translation frequently includes explicit subjects, potentially reflecting the more explicit grammatical structure of the Indic source language. Tense is not grammatically marked on verbs but is inferred from context, temporal adverbs, or specific auxiliary verbs like ""已"" (past) and ""當"" (future). The presence of formulaic repetitions, extensive dialogue, and call-and-response patterns strongly suggests the text originated from or was adapted for oral transmission. There is no overt attempt to reinterpret Buddhist concepts using indigenous Chinese philosophical terminology or frameworks.

The tone is spiritual, using terms like '三昧' (samādhi) for meditation. There is no significant reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophy. While minor expansions might exist due to the nature of early translations, overt interpolations are not evident without comparison to an Indic original.

It is not truly vernacular in the modern sense but less classical than some other literary works. The translation exhibits a predominantly literal style, reflecting the source text's structure and repetitions. This can sometimes make the Chinese prose feel less natural or fluent compared to translations that prioritize idiomatic Chinese expression. The text is verbose, characterized by extensive enumerations and repetitions, a common feature of Indic sutras, faithfully reproduced in the translation. While the choice of Chinese terms might occasionally echo indigenous philosophical concepts (a common challenge in early Buddhist translation), there is no strong evidence within the text of the Buddhist teachings being re-interpreted or fundamentally altered according to indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks. The core Buddhist concepts are largely preserved directly. Without an Indic original, it is difficult to confirm interpolations. However, the general style of Dharmarakṣa is known for literalism, so large-scale interpolations are less likely. Minor explanatory additions for clarity cannot be ruled out. The frequent use of formulaic phrases, direct address, and extensive enumeration (e.g., ""何等為四？一者...""), along with repetition, strongly suggests characteristics of texts intended for oral presentation and transmission.",

The prose also frequently uses 4-character phrases, contributing to a somewhat rhythmic feel. The language style is best described as vernacular in the context of its time; it is simpler, more direct, and less ornate or formally structured than classical literary Chinese prose, often referred to as 'translationese' or a 'hybrid' style, which prioritizes direct meaning over stylistic elegance. The translation tends to be literal, often reflecting the grammatical structures and word order of the Indic original, which can sometimes result in Chinese phrasing that feels less fluid or natural to a reader accustomed to classical Chinese. Despite its directness, the translation can be verbose, particularly in its enumerations and repetitive phrasing (e.g., repeated '則發寶心', '是為如來...之力'), which is a common trait of oral transmission and direct dictation processes.

There is no strong evidence of reinterpretation of Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts; the foreign Buddhist context is largely preserved. No interlinear commentary is present in the provided text, and there are no clear interpolations by the translator beyond potentially clarifying elaborations. Signs of oral transmission are evident, particularly through direct speech attributions ('佛言') and a question-and-answer format ('問曰', '答曰', '報曰') in certain sections. Abbreviations are not used. Sentence subjects are often explicitly stated, rather than being implicitly understood as is common in classical Chinese. The adverb '諸' (zhū) is frequently used to indicate plural forms (e.g., '諸菩薩', '諸佛'). Tense is generally left unspecified, inferred from context or temporal adverbs, consistent with classical Chinese grammar.",

The verse sections (introduced by '頌曰') consistently feature lines of five syllables. The language is highly literary, employing classical vocabulary and grammatical structures, rather than vernacular Chinese. The translation style tends to be literal, which is common for early Chinese Buddhist translations from Indic languages. This is evident in the frequent use of repetitive negation/affirmation structures (e.g., '亦無所說、亦無不說') and enumeration of concepts, which often mirrors the structure of the Indic source. While the vocabulary is not overly ornate, the overall presentation is verbose due to detailed and often repetitive explanations, especially in the extensive sections describing the '法忍' (dharma patience/endurance), as well as the use of lengthy analogies. No indigenous Chinese idioms are observed. The tone is distinctly spiritual, utilizing core Buddhist terms such as '三昧' (samādhi) and '般泥洹' (parinirvāṇa) rather than purely factual equivalents. There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being interpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts (Ge Yi). No interpolations or interlinear commentaries are present. Signs of oral transmission are evident through the call-and-response format ('答曰', '報曰') and direct address to '佛子' (Buddha's son/disciple). Abbreviations are not used. Sentence subjects are frequently explicit or clearly stated, particularly at the beginning of sentences or clauses, which might be a literal translation choice to maintain clarity from a source language that tends to be more explicit than native Classical Chinese. The adverb '諸' (zhū) is extensively used to indicate plural forms (e.g., '諸菩薩', '諸佛', '諸法').

It uses generally plain language for doctrinal exposition, though descriptions of the Buddha's physical form are elaborate. The wording is verbose, characterized by repetition, particularly in the enumeration of the twelve links of dependent origination and the dialogue structure. Few indigenous Chinese idioms are used; the phrasing is primarily a direct translation of Buddhist concepts. The tone is spiritual, focusing on core Buddhist teachings for liberation. There is no evidence of systematic interpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The opening phrase '聞如是' and the dialogue format strongly suggest an origin in oral transmission.

The tone is distinctly spiritual, emphasizing miraculous events and profound Buddhist teachings. While not overtly reinterpreting Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophy, the translation integrates Buddhist terminology into classical Chinese discourse. Interpolations, in the form of elaborate descriptive passages (e.g., of the transformed fire pit), are likely present given the nature of early Chinese Buddhist translation practices and the detailed amplification not always found in Indic originals.

It is verbose, elaborating extensively on various themes of suffering, impermanence, and the path to liberation. Some idiomatic phrases and vivid similes are present, such as ""殃禍響應"" and ""影隨形、響之應聲."" The tone is profoundly spiritual, focusing on Buddhist doctrines of suffering, impermanence, and the attainment of Nirvana. There is evidence of the integration of indigenous Chinese thought, particularly Confucian ethical concepts like filial piety (implied in ""不孝師父"") and the use of terms like ""仁賢知者,"" as well as classical Chinese cosmological framing.

The language is 'plain' and functional, focused on conveying spiritual teachings without ornate embellishment. There is no significant use of Chinese idioms or reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts through 'indigenous Chinese' philosophy, maintaining a direct translation of spiritual terms. The repetitive structure and enumerations strongly suggest an origin in 'oral transmission'. Sentence subjects are often 'implicit' within clauses, relying on context.

Despite its literalness, the language is ornate, particularly in its rich, descriptive vocabulary for spiritual virtues and pure lands. The translation is verbose, characterized by extensive enumerations and repetitive phrases, which also suggests signs of oral transmission. Indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts are not overtly used for interpretation. While early translations like Dharmarakṣa's are sometimes known for expansions, without comparison to a source text, specific interpolations cannot be definitively identified within this text.

This literalness is evident in structures like '實然如仁言' (Indeed it is as your benevolence says) and the frequent repetition of long numerical descriptions such as '億那術百千光明' (hundreds of millions of billions of thousands of light rays). The style is descriptive and functional rather than aesthetically ornate, leading to plain language. However, due to extensive enumerations, detailed descriptions of Buddha's qualities, and repetitions of ideas, the text can be considered verbose. There is no clear evidence of Chinese idioms being incorporated. The overall tone is deeply spiritual, focusing on Buddhist teachings, samadhi, and the Buddha's parinirvana. While early translations sometimes show indigenous Chinese interpretations, the explicit use of terms like '三昧' (samadhi) rather than purely Chinese philosophical equivalents suggests a less pronounced *explicit* reinterpretation of core Buddhist concepts. The text contains no interlinear commentary or obvious interpolations. However, the presence of repetitive phrases, formulaic descriptions (e.g., the emanation of light and subsequent transformations), and the frequent use of direct speech and call-and-response in verse sections strongly suggest an influence of oral transmission or a style designed for oral recitation.

The language is generally plain, focusing on conveying the Buddhist teachings rather than ornate literary embellishment. While not heavily reliant on common secular Chinese idioms, the translation does integrate indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts, such as Confucian virtues like '仁義禮節' (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, etiquette), and frequently uses '道' (Dao) which carries strong Daoist connotations alongside its Buddhist meaning of path.

No discernible indigenous Chinese secular idioms are used; the focus is on Buddhist terminology and direct rendering. The overall tone is spiritual, dealing with Buddhist practices for enlightenment, repentance, and liberation. However, it shows signs of interpretation through indigenous Chinese concepts, notably the use of '本無' (original non-being) to convey emptiness or ultimate reality, a term that resonated with Daoist philosophy in early Chinese Buddhism.

滅十方冥經,T 435 ,mixed,5,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,implicit,True,explicit,False,False,False,"Source Text Style: The original Indic text (likely Sanskrit) would have featured a mixed prose and verse (gāthā) format, characterized by extensive enumerations, repetition of epithets, and formulaic phrases, common in early Buddhist sutras. The theme of invoking Buddhas in specific directions for protection from dangers is also typical of apotropaic Buddhist literature. Translation Style: 1. Verse or Prose: The translation maintains the 'mixed' format, with prose sections narrating the dialogue and events, interspersed with clear verse sections (頌曰) for summaries or teachings. 2. Syllables per line: The verse sections predominantly use 5-syllable lines, with some instances of 4-syllable lines, a common adaptation for Indic gāthās into Chinese poetic forms during early translations. 3. Vernacular or Literary: The translation is rendered in early Literary Chinese (Classical Chinese), consistent with the style of Buddhist sutra translations from the Western Jin period. 4. Literal or Fluent: The translation leans towards 'literal'. This is evident in phrases like '聞如是' (Thus have I heard) and sometimes in the somewhat direct rendering of Indic grammatical structures (e.g., passive voice using '為...所'). The lengthy descriptive names for Buddhas and world systems are often transliterated or translated quite directly. 5. Ornate or Plain Language: The language is generally 'plain' and functional, focused on conveying the narrative and teachings directly. While the subject matter is elevated, there are no excessive literary flourishes or complex metaphors for stylistic embellishment. 6. Terse or Verbose: The translation is 'verbose', primarily due to the extensive repetition of Buddha epithets ('如來、至真、等正覺'), the formulaic presentation for each of the ten directions, and detailed enumerations of benefits and protections. 7. Idioms Used: No distinct Chinese idioms are used, suggesting a direct translation approach without localizing figures of speech. 8. Factual or Spiritual: The tone is primarily 'spiritual'. While some terms describing meditative states (e.g., '禪定不亂') might have a descriptive, factual nuance, the overarching theme of invoking Buddhas for protection, merit, and eventual enlightenment is fundamentally spiritual. 9. Indigenous Chinese Interpretation: There is no apparent reinterpretation of Buddhist teachings according to indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts (e.g., Daoism or Confucianism). The translation style appears to faithfully represent the Indic Buddhist concepts. 10. Interpolations: No clear interpolations by the translator or later editors are evident within the main text of the sutra. 11. Interlinear Commentary: There is no interlinear commentary present in the provided text. 12. Oral Transmission: The text exhibits characteristics of oral transmission, such as repetitive phrasing ('佛告童子'), formulaic structures for different sections, and the opening '聞如是', which suggests a recited tradition. 13. Abbreviations: No abbreviations of terms or names are used; epithets and titles are given in full. 14. Explicit Sentence Subject: The translation frequently omits subjects where they can be inferred from context, a common characteristic of Classical Chinese, hence 'implicit' subjects are prevalent, though explicit subjects are used for clarity when needed. 15. Plural Zhu: The character '諸' (zhū) is frequently used to indicate plural forms, such as '諸菩薩' (all bodhisattvas) and '諸佛剎土' (all Buddha lands). 16. Tense: While Classical Chinese verbs do not have inherent conjugations for tense, tense is 'explicitly' indicated when necessary through the use of temporal adverbs and phrases, such as '今現在說經法' (now currently teaching dharma) for present tense, and '當為汝說' (will speak for you) for future tense, rather than being left purely to contextual inference.",

The translation often appears literal, preserving the structure and repetition of the original, which can sometimes result in a less fluent Chinese style. It employs plain language rather than ornate. The extensive dialogues, enumerations, and repetitions contribute to a verbose style. Chinese idioms are not prominently used. The subject matter and terminology (e.g., 三昧, 善權方便, 無上正真道意) clearly establish a spiritual tone. There is no overt evidence of indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts being used for interpretation, nor are there clear interpolations or interlinear commentaries.

The translation style, characteristic of early works by Dharmarakṣa (竺法護), is quite literal, often adhering closely to the Indic source's syntax and structure, even if it results in a less fluent Chinese reading. This literalness, combined with formulaic repetitions common in Indic texts, makes the overall narrative somewhat verbose, despite the terseness of individual four-character lines. The language is literary rather than vernacular, but it exhibits a distinct 'translationese' (格義) flavor, attempting to directly convey Buddhist concepts without heavily relying on indigenous Chinese philosophical reinterpretation or ornate literary embellishments. The tone is deeply spiritual, focusing on karma, past lives, and the attainment of arhatship. The use of parenthetical notes, like '晉名無焚' or the number of verses in each chapter (e.g., '十九偈'), indicates interpolations and interlinear commentary by the Chinese editors/translators. The highly formulaic and repetitive structure, especially in the concluding lines of each chapter, strongly suggests influence from oral transmission traditions.

The translation style, attributed to Dharmarakṣa (竺法護) during the Western Jin Dynasty, is notably literal, adhering closely to the Indic source's syntax and vocabulary. This often results in a 'translationese' effect, where phrasing may appear somewhat stiff or less fluent by native Chinese literary standards. It employs classical Chinese vocabulary and grammatical structures, making it literary rather than vernacular, but the language is generally plain, prioritizing direct doctrinal transmission over ornate embellishment.

Its literal quality is evident in some phrasing that might sound slightly less natural in Chinese, suggesting a close adherence to the Sanskrit original. The text is generally terse and direct, particularly in its enumerations of dharma practices, and uses plain language. There is no significant use of indigenous Chinese idioms.

The language tends towards plainness and is quite verbose, characteristic of Indic sutra style with frequent repetitions of phrases and formulaic expressions, suggesting an influence from oral transmission traditions. The translation style is more literal, often directly rendering Indic sentence structures and concepts into Chinese, rather than fully naturalizing them into fluent classical Chinese prose. There is no evidence of extensive indigenous Chinese philosophical interpretation, nor the use of Chinese idioms or abbreviations. The frequent use of '諸' (zhū) indicates plural forms.

It often reflects Sanskrit syntax and grammar, sometimes making the Chinese awkward or repetitive (e.g., using '作已' for Sanskrit absolutive participles, or direct rendering of long compounds). The language is plain, prioritizing direct translation over stylistic embellishment. Its literalness and repetitiveness contribute to this plainness rather than an ornate style. The translation is verbose, often due to direct rendering of Sanskrit compounds and repetitive structures, and the explicit unpacking of terms (e.g., 'X, X者，善實！非X，彼，如來說；彼故，說名X者'). While some earlier translations employed 'Geyi' (matching concepts) by using Daoist or Confucian terminology, Jñānagupta's translation belongs to a later period aiming for greater precision and fidelity to the Indic source. Thus, it generally avoids overt reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The text begins with '如是我聞' and frequently uses a question-and-answer format, indicating an oral teaching tradition. The repetitions of phrases and concepts (e.g., '彼何意念？善實！' followed by the answer structure) are also consistent with oral discourse and memorization. While classical Chinese often uses implicit subjects, this translation frequently employs explicit subjects (e.g., '世尊言,' '善實言') and demonstrative pronouns (e.g., '彼') to mark subjects, likely mirroring the more explicit subject-verb structure of the Sanskrit source. Tense is generally unspecified, as is common in Classical Chinese. However, future tense is explicitly indicated using '當有' (dāng yǒu), for example, '實想發生當有' (will there be the arising of the thought of reality?).

The language is Classical Chinese, using formal vocabulary and grammatical structures characteristic of early Buddhist translations, not the spoken language of the time. The translation often directly mirrors Indic syntax and terminology, leading to a somewhat formal and at times less flowing Chinese style, especially in its direct rendering of concepts and enumerations. While formal and rich in spiritual concepts, the language is not overly ornate or decorative. It prioritizes the precise conveyance of Buddhist doctrine rather than elaborate literary embellishment. The text is verbose, characterized by extensive enumerations (e.g., 80 practices, various sets of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 items) and a repetitive structure where prose is often followed by a summary in verse.

摩訶鉢羅若波羅蜜經抄,T 226 (5),prose,0,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,implicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The source text, likely Sanskrit, features a prose style characterized by extensive dialogue, narrative explanations, and the use of similes and parables to convey complex spiritual concepts. It exhibits a certain degree of repetition in its exposition, indicative of an oral discourse tradition designed for instruction and memorization. The content is deeply spiritual and philosophical, focusing on Mahayana Buddhist teachings, particularly Prajñāpāramitā. The Chinese translation exhibits characteristics common in early Chinese Buddhist texts from the Qin dynasty, a period known for more literal translations. The prose structure is maintained, primarily as dialogue between the Buddha and Subhūti, interspersed with narrative. As it is prose, there is no fixed syllable count per line. The language used is literary Chinese, utilizing classical sentence structures and vocabulary, though lacking the extreme ornateness of some later, more polished translations. The translation style is notably literal, evident in direct transliteration of Sanskrit terms (e.g., 摩訶般若波羅蜜, 菩薩摩訶薩, 阿耨多羅三耶三菩) and phrasing that appears to directly follow the syntax of the source language, occasionally leading to less natural Chinese. The language is plain and direct, without extensive literary embellishment. The text is verbose due to frequent repetitions of phrases and concepts, likely reflecting the source text's style for clarity and aiding oral transmission. There is an absence of indigenous Chinese idioms. The tone is distinctly spiritual, centered on Buddhist philosophical and soteriological concepts. There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being interpreted or syncretized with indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The provided text shows no overt signs of later interpolations or interlinear commentary. The dialogue format, along with repetitive phrases and enumerations, strongly indicates an oral transmission tradition. Standard transliterated forms are used; there are no discernible abbreviations. While subjects are sometimes explicitly stated, especially with speaker attribution, a significant number of sentences omit the subject, relying on context, which is typical of classical Chinese grammar. The character 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to denote plural forms (e.g., 諸佛, 諸法). Tense is not explicitly marked grammatically but is inferred from context or temporal adverbs.",

It begins with a series of 5-syllable verses before transitioning into a lengthy prose section. The translation style is highly literal, typical of early Chinese Buddhist translations, prioritizing accuracy of terms and structure over natural Chinese flow. This results in some stiffness and repetition. The language is literary and plain, focusing on precise Buddhist terminology. The overall exposition is verbose due to extensive explanations, enumerations, and presentation of multiple viewpoints through the '問曰' (Question asks) and '答曰' (Answer says) format, as well as frequent '或曰' (or says/some say) phrases. Sentence subjects are predominantly implicit. The character 諸 (zhū) is commonly used to indicate plural forms. Tense is generally left unspecified, relying on context or specific temporal adverbs where needed. The source text's scholastic nature, with its Q&A format and debate-like structure, suggests roots in academic discourse, which may have included oral transmission in its development, but the Chinese translation itself is a formal written record. There are instances of interlinear commentary providing brief explanations or source references. No indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts are used to interpret the Buddhist teachings, nor are there any obvious interpolations or abbreviations by the translator.",

The language is highly literary, reflecting a direct, often word-for-word translation style from the Indic original, which can lead to a somewhat stilted or repetitive Chinese. This literal approach results in plain, technical language focused on precise definitions rather than ornate prose. The text is verbose due to the extensive definitions, repetitive explanations of terms, and the inclusion of multiple scholastic interpretations (indicated by phrases like '或曰', meaning 'or it is said' or 'some say'). While the subject matter is spiritual, the treatment is highly analytical and definitional, typical of Abhidharma, giving it a factual tone. There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The repeated '或曰' statements suggest the inclusion of differing scholarly views, which are part of the commentary tradition of the text itself. Interlinear commentary is present in the form of small parenthetical glosses (e.g., '(兄也)', '(中陰也)'). The repetitive question-and-answer format and the reiteration of definitions are strong indicators of a style conducive to oral transmission and memorization. Abbreviations are not used within the main text flow. Sentence subjects are often implicit when clear from context, a common feature of classical Chinese.

While the overall exposition is extensive and covers many points in detail, the phrasing and wording within individual explanations tend to be concise and direct, making the language terse rather than verbose. Repetitive phrasing and the question-and-answer format suggest an origin or transmission method that facilitated memorization, indicative of oral tradition. Buddhist terms are rendered using Chinese conceptual equivalents (e.g., 定 for concentration/samadhi) rather than transliterations, and the approach is highly analytical, lending a factual tone to the spiritual subject matter.

For 'syllables_per_line', 4 is chosen as the most common for the verse sections. The language is literary, employing Classical Chinese with a high density of technical Buddhist vocabulary. The translation style appears quite literal, reflecting the common approach in early Chinese Buddhist translations from Indic languages, sometimes resulting in direct or somewhat stiff phrasing, and faithfully preserving source structures. The language is plain and functional, prioritizing the clear exposition of complex concepts over ornate literary embellishment, except for the poetic style inherent in the gathas themselves. The text is verbose, characterized by extensive enumerations, repetitive question-and-answer sequences ('問曰' '答曰'), and multiple alternative explanations ('或曰') for each point, suggesting a thorough, scholastic debate style. Few common Chinese secular idioms are used; the terminology is primarily Buddhist. The overall tone for presenting Buddhist concepts is analytical, definitional, and expository, leaning towards a 'factual' style of explanation. There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being interpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts; the focus remains on direct translation of Indic ideas. The '或曰' structure indicates internal alternative views or scholastic debates, not external interpolations in the sense of extraneous additions to the text. No interlinear commentary is present. The pervasive '問曰', '答曰', and '或曰' patterns strongly suggest a style rooted in or simulating oral debate and transmission. No obvious abbreviations are used. Sentence subjects are often explicitly stated, especially for clarity within the question-and-answer format. The adverb 諸 (zhu) is frequently used to indicate plural forms, such as in '諸惡' (all evils) or '諸根' (all faculties).

This is evident in repetitive phrases, direct renderings of technical terms, and sentence constructions that can feel convoluted in Chinese but reflect Sanskrit syntax. While 4-syllable lines are very common in the embedded gathas (verses), some gathas also feature 5-syllable lines (e.g., in the 'sea' metaphor section). 4 is chosen as a representative common length for the verse sections. The overarching tone is analytical and systematic, typical of Abhidharma literature, which aims to provide a factual, categorical description of reality (dharmas) from a Buddhist perspective. While spiritual concepts like ""emptiness samādhi"" (空三昧) and ""concentration"" (定) are discussed, their treatment within the text is primarily through detailed analysis and categorization rather than evocative spiritual prose. While classical Chinese often omits subjects, this translation frequently includes explicit subjects, particularly in the question-and-answer sections (e.g., ""世尊告曰"", ""梵志曰"", ""阿毘曇者說曰"", ""尊者X說曰"") and when introducing different viewpoints (""或曰彼作經者無事"", ""或曰謂此入中說"").

The translation style by Sanghabhadra during the Former Qin dynasty is largely literal, prioritizing fidelity to the Indic original's terminology and structure. This results in prose that can be repetitive and sometimes less fluent in Chinese, directly reflecting the source's methodical and analytical nature. The repeated use of phrases like '或曰' (or it is said) and the extensive Q&A structure are direct renderings of the scholastic debate style.

The translation often follows the Indic source structure closely, leading to somewhat rigid or repetitive phrasing (e.g., frequent ""問曰"", ""答曰"", ""謂...者""), which can feel less fluid in Chinese than a more paraphrastic or interpretative approach. The language is primarily functional and didactic, focused on conveying doctrinal explanations and arguments without extensive literary embellishment or florid rhetoric.

The text primarily uses direct, explanatory language and technical Buddhist terminology rather than traditional Chinese literary idioms. It approaches spiritual concepts (like the four immeasurables) with a systematic, analytical, and doctrinal explanation, classifying their nature, function, and effects, characteristic of Abhidharma discourse. As an early translation of a Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma text (Vibhāṣā), it aims to convey Indic Buddhist philosophical concepts accurately, with no apparent reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks. The text includes lengthy narrative examples and extended explanations (introduced by ""說曰"" or ""或曰"") that, while illustrative, might represent additions or elaborations by the translator or compilers to the core scholastic discourse of a śāstra, or expansions from the Indic source that go beyond a terse exposition. This is common in early translation efforts to clarify meaning. Features such as extensive repetition of phrases (e.g., Q&A format, ""有一說者""), formulaic structures, and the inclusion of numerous detailed narrative parables are indicative of material that was likely designed for oral transmission and memorization. While classical Chinese can omit subjects, this translation frequently employs explicit subjects, particularly in its structured Q&A format (""問曰"", ""答曰"", ""世尊告曰"") and narrative sections, for clarity.

The verses consistently adhere to a 5-syllable per line structure. The translation style, particularly evident in the prose explanations, is highly literal, often providing word-for-word interpretations or multiple possible meanings for each phrase in the original Indic verse. This literalness contributes to a somewhat stiff Chinese rendering, focusing on preserving the original sense even at the expense of natural Chinese flow. While the verses themselves are terse, the accompanying explanations are very verbose, often re-explaining terms and concepts repetitively using phrases like '復作是說' ('further it is said'), which suggests a didactic purpose, possibly for oral transmission or teaching. The language used is literary Chinese rather than vernacular, but it prioritizes clarity in explanation over ornate embellishment, resulting in a generally plain language for the commentary. The subject matter is entirely spiritual, although the commentary may break down spiritual terms into more 'factual' or definitional equivalents. Buddhist concepts are explained using their own terminology without overt interpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. Explicit sentence subjects are frequently used in the prose commentary to maintain clarity, despite the general tendency in classical Chinese for implicit subjects.

The translation appears quite literal, often adhering closely to the structure and repetition found in Indic source texts, resulting in some repetitive phrasing and a somewhat stiff Chinese style (e.g., the frequent use of '以是之故' and repeated clauses). The language is predominantly plain, focusing on the direct conveyance of Buddhist doctrines and narratives without excessive literary adornment. The text is verbose, characterized by significant repetition of phrases and ideas, particularly in the long descriptive sections. No distinct Chinese idioms (成語) are prominently or frequently used.

The translation style is quite literal, often leading to verbose and somewhat stiff phrasing in Chinese, as evidenced by repetitive structures like '此亦如是' (this is also like that) and direct mapping of concepts. The original Indic source appears to have been ornate, and the translation preserves this through extensive use of similes and metaphors, rather than simplifying it. Idioms are not frequently used. The tone is distinctly spiritual, utilizing Buddhist technical terms like '三昧' (samādhi) and focusing on the Buddha's enlightened qualities and the path to liberation. There are no clear signs of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted according to indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. While not strictly 'interlinear' in visual placement, parenthetical explanatory notes (e.g., '(二種草)', '(似鸚鵡)') are embedded within the text, serving a similar function to commentary. The repetitive phrases, formulaic openings ('爾時世尊云何...'), and the mixed prose-verse format are strong indicators of a text composed or transmitted with an oral tradition in mind.

The language is plain and functional, focused on conveying precise meanings rather than ornate expression. The style is terse, offering concise definitions and answers. There are no apparent indigenous Chinese idioms used, nor is there evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through local Chinese philosophical concepts. The tone is analytical and systematic, typical of Abhidharma, classifying concepts in a factual manner (e.g., using '定' for concentration). The preface explicitly details the translation process involving a reciter (執梵), translators (為譯), and scribes (筆受), confirming oral transmission. Numerous parenthetical notes provide explanations of terms and phrases, functioning as interlinear commentary.

The language is classical Chinese, formal and dense, typical of Buddhist translations of the era, but can sometimes feel somewhat stiff or repetitive, lacking the refined literary elegance of later, more polished translations. The translation exhibits a strong literal tendency, marked by frequent '修妬路' (sūtra) annotations, direct renderings that sometimes result in less fluid Chinese, and numerous parenthetical clarifications that suggest an effort to closely adhere to the source's structure and meaning. The language is functional and explanatory, focusing on defining and categorizing Buddhist concepts, thus being plain. While individual Q&A responses can be concise, the overall style, with its extensive parenthetical explanations, explicit reiterations of terms, and systematic breakdown of concepts, leans towards verbosity, prioritizing comprehensive detail. No distinctive indigenous Chinese idioms are observed. The text adopts an analytical and classificatory approach to Buddhist teachings, systematically defining terms and categories, thus taking a factual tone. There is no evident reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks.

The commentary notes are primarily inline (within parentheses or introduced by '修妬路') rather than physically placed between lines of text (interlinear). Explicit phrases such as '(其人云此中應有失憂)' indicate that the translation or its transmission involved an oral component or relied on spoken glosses. No discernible abbreviations of Chinese characters or standard Buddhist terms are used. While classical Chinese often allows for implicit subjects, this text frequently uses explicit subjects, particularly '彼' (that/those) or proper nouns like '世尊', especially when defining or referring to specific entities, though many questions and descriptive clauses still have implicit subjects. The character '諸' (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plural forms (e.g., 諸行路, 諸大, 諸結盡).

The language employs classical Chinese structures and vocabulary, typical of Buddhist scriptures of the period, rather than a colloquial or modern vernacular style. The translation often re-states verse lines directly within the prose commentary using formulaic phrases like '是故說曰' (therefore it is said), suggesting a close, word-for-word or phrase-for-phrase adherence to the source text's structure, which can sometimes feel less natural in Chinese. The language is primarily functional and explanatory, focusing on conveying Buddhist concepts clearly.

Each concise verse is followed by a lengthy prose explanation, often providing detailed elaborations, analogies, and narratives (e.g., the Nanda story), making the overall presentation quite expansive. The text primarily uses direct language and Buddhist technical terms rather than a heavy reliance on indigenous Chinese idioms or established *chengyu*. The text's focus is on moral conduct, understanding suffering, transcending worldly attachments, and achieving spiritual liberation (Nirvana), emphasizing the path away from defilements like lust, anger, and delusion. The text explains Buddhist concepts using traditional Buddhist narratives and analogies, without apparent reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The extensive prose commentary, including narratives like the Nanda story and detailed enumerations (e.g., the four streams), appears to be an expansion or elaboration on the succinct verses by the translator/compiler, common in early translations to clarify complex ideas. The commentary is presented in block paragraphs following each verse, not as interlinear notes. While some repetition and formulaic phrases ('是故說曰') are present, the structured prose and narratives suggest a written compilation rather than a direct transcription of oral teaching, lacking distinct markers of spontaneous oral delivery. Standard Buddhist technical terms are used in their full form; no explicit abbreviations are identified.

The text is composed in classical literary Chinese, typical of Buddhist sutra translations from the Eastern Jin dynasty, rather than contemporary spoken vernacular. The translation exhibits a strong tendency towards literalism, maintaining the repetitive and formulaic structures of the Indic source text (e.g., repeating long descriptive passages for each animal in the '烏鳥喻經' and consistent phrasing in dialogues). This fidelity to source structure sometimes results in less fluid Chinese, but it prioritizes accurate transmission of content. The language is primarily plain and functional, focused on conveying the doctrinal content and narrative directly. It avoids elaborate rhetorical flourishes or extensive descriptive embellishments beyond what is necessary for the similes and narrative progression inherent in the original sutra style. The text is verbose, largely due to the extensive use of repetition of descriptions, questions, and stock phrases, which is a characteristic feature of early Buddhist sutras, faithfully preserved in this translation. No distinct Chinese chengyu (idioms) are identified; the language is a direct rendering of the Indic original into classical Chinese. The text's discourse centers on Buddhist teachings, practices (like mindfulness and concentration leading to liberation), and the spiritual progress of practitioners, thus having a distinctly spiritual tone.

The text is fundamentally spiritual, focusing on advanced Buddhist concepts like prajñāpāramitā, samādhi, emptiness (空), and enlightenment (阿耨多羅三藐三菩提), which are spiritual goals. While it presents these concepts in a systematic and analytical (factual) manner, the ultimate aim and nature of the content are spiritual. The translation largely presents Buddhist concepts directly, using transliterations (like ""波羅蜜"") and direct explanations of emptiness (空). It does not appear to reinterpret Buddhist teachings through pre-existing Chinese philosophical frameworks like Daoism or Confucianism, as some earlier translations occasionally did (gaya). The highly repetitive phrasing, such as the numerous instances of ""欲知X，當學般若波羅蜜"" or the detailed enumerations of various samādhis and emptiness types, is a characteristic rhetorical device found in ancient Indian texts, strongly suggesting an underlying oral tradition in the source material which is preserved in the translation style. While classical Chinese often allows for implicit subjects, this translation frequently explicitly states the subjects, especially in dialogue (""須菩提白佛言"", ""舍利弗問須菩提"") and in expository sections (""菩薩摩訶薩欲具足..."", ""是菩薩摩訶薩行般若波羅蜜時...""), which contributes to clarity in a didactic text and reflects a tendency to clearly identify actors in translated material.

Kumārajīva's translation is known for its elegant and refined Chinese, which leans towards a literary style, albeit accessible. It's not colloquial vernacular, nor is it overly archaic or obscure. Kumārajīva is famous for his fluent and idiomatic translations, prioritizing readability and accurate conveying of meaning over strict word-for-word literalism from Sanskrit. The language is clear, direct, and lacks excessive embellishment. Its profoundness comes from the concepts, not decorative phrasing. The text is concise in its individual statements, but it often repeats key concepts and rhetorical structures (e.g., ""A is not A, therefore it is A"") for emphasis and to drive home the teaching. The translation uses Buddhist technical terms (both transliterated and translated) but does not notably incorporate indigenous Chinese idioms. The rhetorical style is reminiscent of the source text. The text primarily deals with profound spiritual and philosophical concepts of Mahayana Buddhism, such as emptiness, non-duality, and the nature of Buddhahood and enlightenment. It employs Sanskrit transliterations for many key spiritual terms (e.g., 阿耨多羅三藐三菩提, 般若波羅蜜, 三昧). Kumārajīva's translations are generally renowned for their fidelity to the Indic originals, attempting to convey Buddhist ideas without heavily interpreting them through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks like Daoism or Confucianism.

His style is notably fluent, prioritizing the clear conveyance of meaning over strict literalism, and uses plain, concise language. While the overall address is often explicit ('汝等比丘'), within sentences, subjects are frequently implicit, a common feature of Classical Chinese.

The explanations are verbose, utilizing analogies and a question-and-answer format to elaborate on concepts. This Q&A structure and the somewhat repetitive nature of certain explanations suggest a pedagogical style that may be influenced by or mimic oral transmission. While the prose is generally plain and instructional, the embedded verse section provides a poetic dimension.

The translation style, typical of Kumārajīva, prioritizes fluency in Chinese while sometimes employing transliterations for Indic terms (e.g., 三昧 for samādhi, 阿羅漢 for arhat) which are often clarified through parenthetical explanations. These parenthetical notes serve as interpolations and interlinear commentary, explicitly bridging Indic concepts with the Chinese reader, often noting where no direct Chinese equivalent exists, indicating a conscious effort to avoid indigenous Chinese interpretations. The language used is plain and direct, focusing on instructional content rather than ornate literary flourishes. The text is quite verbose, providing extensive details and elaborations on various Buddhist concepts, stages of meditation, and paths to enlightenment. It does not heavily rely on traditional Chinese idioms. The tone is primarily spiritual, discussing meditative states and paths to liberation.

雜譬喻經,T 207,prose,5,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,True,True,False,True,explicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The text is predominantly prose, narrating various parables. However, it includes occasional explicit verse sections, such as a daughter's question in a four-line gatha and a mention of 'seventy gathas', which typically follow a fixed syllable count. While the main text is prose with varied sentence lengths, the explicit verse sections (like the daughter's question) consistently use five characters per line, characteristic of Chinese gathas. This integer reflects those specific verse portions. The language is not purely vernacular but leans towards a simpler, more accessible form of literary Chinese, distinct from highly ornate classical prose. It's designed for broader comprehension rather than elevated aestheticism. The translation exhibits characteristics of early Buddhist translations, often rendering Indic concepts and sentence structures quite directly. This approach can lead to a literal rather than fully naturalized Chinese expression. The text uses plain and direct language, focusing on clear narrative and didactic explanations. It avoids elaborate metaphors or sophisticated literary embellishments, consistent with its function as a collection of parables. The text is verbose in its narrative and explanations. Each parable is thoroughly detailed, often followed by explicit interpretative notes (e.g., '此喻...' - 'This illustrates...') that elaborate on the moral or spiritual meaning, ensuring clarity for the audience. The text employs common literary expressions of the era, but it does not heavily rely on complex or obscure indigenous Chinese idioms. Its language is generally straightforward, prioritizing clarity in conveying Buddhist teachings. The translation frequently retains transliterated Sanskrit terms for key Buddhist concepts (e.g., samādhi, arhat, bodhisattva, nirvana, prajna). This preference for Indic spiritual terminology over purely Chinese factual equivalents indicates a spiritual tone. There are indications of interpreting Buddhist teachings with an awareness of indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts and a strategy to make them relatable to a Chinese audience, reflecting tendencies of early 'Geyi' (格義) translation. For instance, in parable (17), the Tathagata's adaptation of teachings to suit sentient beings' understanding demonstrates this. The consistent presence of explicit explanatory notes at the end of many parables ('此喻...') suggests additions made by the Chinese translator or early redactors to clarify the didactic message for a Chinese audience, rather than being part of the original Indic source. The provided text does not contain any interlinear commentary. Explanatory elements are integrated into the main narrative or presented as concluding notes to each parable. Signs of oral transmission include the repetitive '昔有...' (Once there was...) structure for introducing parables, the prevalence of dialogue, and the didactic explanations, all of which are suitable for oral instruction and narration. Subjects are frequently stated, particularly when introducing new actors or changing focus. While not every clause has an explicit subject, the usage is more explicit than what is common in very terse classical Chinese. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plural forms for nouns, such as 諸佛 (all Buddhas), 諸弟子 (all disciples), and 諸天 (all devas). Tense is generally left unspecified on verbs, with temporal adverbs (e.g., 昔, 時, 今, 後) and the sequential flow of events used to convey the timing of actions, consistent with classical Chinese grammatical patterns.

The translation by Kumarajiva is renowned for its fluent, abbreviated, and plain style, adapting the verbose Indic originals to Chinese literary tastes. Sengrui's preface explicitly mentions this abbreviation, stating that two-thirds of the original was removed for brevity. The Q&A format and the 'Thus have I heard' opening reflect oral transmission traditions. The translation uses '諸' to indicate plurals and generally has implicit sentence subjects. Tense is largely unspecified, relying on context. While the content is Indian Buddhist philosophy, Kumarajiva's translation choices, including analogies and terminology, often facilitated understanding through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks, making it accessible to a Chinese audience.",

It combines detailed doctrinal explanations in prose with illustrative verses (gathas), which typically feature four syllables per line. Interlinear commentary, such as '(秦言牛呞)' (Qin translation: 'ox chewing'), is present to clarify transliterated Sanskrit terms. The verbose nature is characteristic of the commentary genre, which thoroughly expounds on Buddhist concepts, narratives (e.g., the First Buddhist Council), and the attributes of a Buddha. Sentence subjects are frequently explicit, especially in the didactic and dialogic sections, enhancing clarity. The plural form '諸' (zhū) is extensively used.

The verse sections display varying syllable counts per line, frequently appearing as 4-character or 5-character lines, but also occasionally as 7-character lines. Kumārajīva's translation style is characterized by its fluency and adherence to literary Chinese, making it accessible while retaining elegance. The extensive use of a question-and-answer format (問曰/答曰), detailed explanations, and numerous parables contribute to its verbose nature. While the ultimate aim is spiritual enlightenment, the exposition is systematic and scholastic. Parenthetical explanations, such as ""(阿難者，秦言歡喜)"", serve as interlinear commentary. The didactic and narrative presentation, including the Q&A format and parables, strongly suggests an origin or adaptation for oral transmission. Subjects are often explicitly stated for clarity, particularly within the explanatory dialogues. The plural marker 諸 (zhū) is commonly used, for example, in ""諸佛"" (all Buddhas) and ""諸比丘"" (all monks). Tense is generally left unspecified, relying on contextual cues.

Prose sentence length varies significantly. The language is classical, scholarly Chinese, characterized by formal vocabulary and syntax typical of early Buddhist translations. The translation, by Kumārajīva, strikes a balance, aiming for clarity and accessibility in Chinese while remaining faithful to the Indic source. It avoids overly literal word-for-word translation, leaning towards a fluent and readable style for the Chinese audience. The inclusion of transliterated terms with explanations also reflects this balance. The language is plain and direct, prioritizing the clear exposition of complex philosophical and doctrinal content. Descriptive passages, such as those detailing the 32 marks, are factual rather than elaborately stylized. While individual sentences can be concise, the overall text is verbose due to the extensive explanations, enumerations, and detailed narrative accounts (e.g., Jataka stories, the 32 marks), thoroughly elaborating on points through a question-and-answer format. There are no distinctively Chinese cultural idioms that significantly shape the meaning. Common classical Chinese phrases are used, but not unique local idioms. The text discusses spiritual concepts and doctrines (e.g., Bodhisattvas, enlightenment, karma) with a highly analytical, scholastic, and systematic approach, presenting them in a factual and logical manner, often through debates between different schools. The text is a direct translation and commentary on Indian Buddhist thought (Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka tradition) and does not interpret Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts like Daoism or Confucianism. No evidence of content interpolations (unauthorized additions to the core meaning of the source text) by the Chinese translator or later editors within the main body of the commentary; the different viewpoints discussed are part of the original commentary. Explicit parenthetical explanations (e.g., ""(受胎七日赤白精和合時也)"") clarify Sanskrit transliterations or technical terms within the main text. The frequent use of a question-and-answer format (問曰/答曰) and the inclusion of lengthy narrative examples (Jataka tales) suggest a style influenced by oral pedagogical traditions or debates, even if presented in a written scholastic work. Classical Chinese grammar allows for frequent omission of sentence subjects, which is observed throughout this text. Subjects are often implied by context rather than explicitly stated. The character 諸 (zhū) is extensively used to indicate plural forms (e.g., 諸佛, 諸菩薩, 諸眾生). Tense is generally not grammatically indicated in classical Chinese verbs; temporal adverbs and contextual clues are used to denote time, rather than explicit verb conjugations.

The Q&A format, verbose explanations, and frequent repetitions suggest an origin influenced by oral transmission. Kumārajīva's translation is in literary Classical Chinese, aiming for fluency and clarity rather than strict literality.

The language used is classical and literary, appropriate for Buddhist scriptures and philosophical commentary, yet it aims for clarity and accessibility rather than excessive ornamentation. The text is quite verbose, characterized by repetition for emphasis and detailed explanations of concepts, particularly within the commentary sections ('論'). The tone is deeply spiritual, focusing on profound Buddhist wisdom, merits, and the path to enlightenment (e.g., Prajnaparamita, Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi). While the text itself is a commentary (論) on a sutra (經), naturally expanding upon the core teachings, there are no indications of interpolations added by the translator that would be extraneous to the expected scope of such a traditional Buddhist commentary. Characteristics often associated with oral transmission, such as extensive repetition and formulaic lists (e.g., types of heavens, spiritual attainments), are evident throughout.

The spiritual tone is maintained through the extensive use of transliterated Sanskrit terms for key Buddhist concepts (e.g., Prajñāpāramitā, Bodhisattva Mahasattva, Sarvajñā), rather than attempting to replace them with purely Chinese philosophical equivalents, thus preserving the Indic Buddhist flavor. No overt interpretations based on indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts are apparent in the translation style of the text itself; the commentary explains the Buddhist doctrine. The commentary sections are distinct from the sutra quotes and do not represent interpolations into the sutra text by the translator. There is no interlinear commentary, only block commentary.

The language is primarily literary Chinese, employing formal vocabulary and grammatical structures, rather than colloquial expressions. This is typical for scholarly Buddhist translations of the era. The translation style appears more literal. This is evidenced by the highly systematic and often repetitive enumeration of points (e.g., ""有二種果報。一者...二者...""), the direct rendering of technical terms, and the detailed, almost verbatim listing of characteristics, which reflects the scholastic style of the Indic source. While Kumārajīva is known for fluency, his translations of śāstra can still retain a degree of literalness to preserve the source's logical structure.

This thoroughness often involves repetition for clarity. No distinct indigenous Chinese idioms are observed; the language is technical and formal. The tone is primarily factual and scholastic, presenting Buddhist teachings as a systematic body of knowledge and practice. It uses precise technical terms and categorizations to explain karma, precepts, afflictions, and ascetic disciplines, aiming for clear doctrinal exposition rather than emotive spiritual evocation. There is no significant evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts.

This mix of forms is typical for Indian śāstras translated into Chinese. The verses (gathas) predominantly feature lines of five characters/syllables, though some lines are four characters, often paired to form eight-character couplets. The language used is classical Chinese, characterized by its formal grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structures. Kumārajīva's translation is known for its relatively fluent and elegant Chinese compared to earlier, more literal translations. However, the philosophical arguments and the direct question-and-answer style of the commentary often reflect the logical structure and terminology of the Indic source, sometimes resulting in a sense of literalness in conveying concepts. While Sengrui's preface contains some literary flourishes, the main body of the text (Qingmu's commentary and the verses) utilizes clear, straightforward language primarily aimed at explaining profound Buddhist philosophical concepts without excessive ornamentation. The verses are highly concise and direct. The commentary, while providing explanations, maintains a focused and often terse style, particularly in its argumentative structure (問曰, 答曰), which contributes to its directness rather than verbosity. Common Chinese idioms (成語 chengyu) are not extensively or characteristically used within the commentary or the verses, which focus on direct philosophical exposition. The text's approach is highly analytical and argumentative, dissecting phenomena through logic and reasoning to establish the 'factual' emptiness of inherent existence. While the ultimate aim is spiritual liberation, the mode of discourse is intellectual and philosophical. The translation primarily aims to convey Indian Buddhist philosophical concepts directly. There is no significant reinterpretation or assimilation of Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks like Daoism or Confucianism within the core translated text or its commentary. The text maintains the structure of a root verse text (kārikā) followed by its commentary, which is standard for Indic śāstras. There are no apparent textual interpolations or additions beyond this expected structure. The commentary is presented in blocks after each verse or section of verses, rather than being placed between lines of the main text. The frequent use of a dialectical '問曰' (Question asks) and '答曰' (Answer says) structure, along with the mnemonic quality of the verses, strongly suggests an origin or influence from oral teaching, debate, or catechism traditions. While explicit subjects appear, particularly when referring to specific agents (e.g., Buddha, authors, other schools), classical Chinese often allows for implicit subjects where the context makes the agent or topic clear, a characteristic seen frequently in the philosophical exposition. The character 諸 (zhū) is commonly and consistently used as a pluralizer, for example, in '諸佛' (all Buddhas), '諸法' (all phenomena), and '諸戲論' (all proliferations).

The language is direct and philosophical ('plain') and concise ('terse'), particularly in the verses. While not overtly decorative, it uses sophisticated classical Chinese expressions that function as fixed phrases or idioms. The discourse on emptiness and dependent arising is presented with logical arguments, giving it a 'factual' tone despite the spiritual subject matter. The translation faithfully renders Indian Madhyamaka concepts without significant reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. There is no interlinear commentary or unacknowledged interpolations by the translator into the original Indic texts. The '問曰' (someone asks) and '答曰' (responds) structure is a rhetorical device for presenting arguments, not a direct sign of oral transmission. Abbreviations are not used.

The translation aims for fluency but retains structural repetitions and formulaic expressions common in Indic philosophical texts. The core translated text uses plain, direct language for philosophical arguments. The accompanying preface by Sengrui, however, is notably ornate and uses sophisticated rhetorical devices. The tone is factual in its rigorous logical and analytical approach to Buddhist philosophical concepts, even though the ultimate aim is spiritual liberation. The interpretation of Buddhist teachings in the treatise adheres closely to its original Mādhyamika framework, rather than reinterpreting through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts, although the preface uses some terms that might echo Daoist thought. Interpolations and interlinear commentary are present in the parenthetical notes within the 品目 (Table of Contents). The dialogue format and repetitive structures suggest characteristics of oral transmission from the source text. Abbreviations are not used.

This repetition, along with frequent re-statement of subjects, contributes to a verbose style and is indicative of features often associated with oral transmission. The language is plain and functional, lacking ornate embellishments. While not colloquial vernacular, its directness and structural adherence to the source text place it distinct from highly classical literary Chinese.

The syllable count for verse lines varies, with 5 and 6 syllables per line observed, 5 being a common length in the latter verse sections. The translation style is quite literal, often reflecting the structure and repetition found in Indic (likely Sanskrit) source texts, for instance, by using direct transliterations like '佛婆伽婆' (Buddha Bhagavan) instead of a more fluent '佛世尊'. This literalness and the detailed, repetitive nature of recounting rules and events (e.g., the full list of ten 'evil matters' and the extensive Q&A during the councils) contribute to a verbose style rather than a terse one. The language used is classical Chinese, falling into the 'literary' category, but presented in a plain rather than ornate manner. There are no readily apparent Chinese idioms. The use of '三昧' (samādhi) for meditative states, as per the rubric's example, indicates a spiritual approach to terminology. There is no evidence of Buddhist concepts being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks. Given the nature of Vinaya texts, which often include elaborate narratives (nidāna) to explain the context of rules, and the general tendency of early translations to expand for clarity in a new cultural context, interpolations (in the sense of narrative elaborations) are likely present. There is no interlinear commentary. Strong indicators of oral transmission are present, such as the highly repetitive formulas used to conclude discussions ('是法、是毘尼、是佛教，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持！') and the extensive call-and-response (Q&A) format throughout the council proceedings. Abbreviations are not used; phrases and names are generally rendered in full. Sentence subjects are often explicitly stated, which aids clarity and is consistent with a literal translation aiming to avoid ambiguity.

The verbosity stems from extensive repetition in the question-and-answer format, a feature likely retained from the Indic source for clarity in oral transmission. While sentence subjects are often explicit when introducing a new speaker or action, they are frequently omitted when clear from context, aligning with typical classical Chinese grammatical patterns.

The syntax often closely mirrors the source language, leading to phrasing that can feel somewhat un-idiomatic in Chinese. The language is predominantly plain and functional, devoid of ornate embellishment, which is appropriate for a rulebook. While individual rule statements are concise, the overall text exhibits verbosity through frequent repetition of procedural phrases (e.g., '今問諸大德是中清淨不？' and its repeated answer) and the full reiteration of questions, which serves to ensure clarity and emphasis for oral recitation. There are no indigenous Chinese idioms used, and Buddhist teachings are not interpreted through Chinese philosophical concepts. The tone is primarily factual, focusing on specific actions, offenses, and disciplinary procedures, even though the ultimate goal of monastic practice is spiritual. The text contains clear signs of oral transmission, such as call-and-response patterns and repetitive structures, which facilitate memorization and recitation during monastic assemblies. Both explicit interpolations (like the parenthetical instruction '(一人應言：布薩說戒。)') and interlinear commentary (like section markers '(七十)') are present, suggesting the inclusion of editorial or instructional notes. Sentence subjects are generally explicit, particularly '若比丘' (if a bhikṣu), '僧' (the sangha), or '諸大德' (O Venerables), crucial for legal clarity.

This commitment to fidelity sometimes results in verbose passages that may feel less ""fluent"" by modern Chinese standards, but it prioritizes accuracy in conveying the detailed legal aspects of the Vinaya.

The *translation style* is functional and direct, focusing on legalistic clarity. It leans towards a literal rendering to preserve the original meaning and structure, sometimes resulting in somewhat repetitive or formal phrasing in Chinese. It employs a specific 'translation literary' style, distinct from highly classical Chinese, but also not vernacular speech. Subjects are often explicit to maintain clarity in prescriptive rules. The frequent use of '諸' (zhū) for pluralization is a notable feature, common in early Buddhist translations to explicitly mark plurals which might be ambiguous in classical Chinese. The explicit definitions like '義如上' (meaning as above) are likely interpolations added during the translation or editing process for clarity for Chinese readers.

All verse sections consistently employ five syllables per line, a common meter in early Chinese Buddhist translations of gāthās. The language is formal classical Chinese, characteristic of early Buddhist translations, employing classical grammar and vocabulary rather than everyday vernacular. The translation leans towards a literal rendering of the Indic source. This is evident in the directness of some phrases, repetitions, and the structure of dialogues, which sometimes feels less natural in Chinese but aims for fidelity to the original's expression and tone. The language is plain and functional, prioritizing the clear transmission of doctrine and narrative over elaborate literary embellishments or complex rhetorical devices. The text is verbose, characterized by frequent repetitions of phrases, formulas, and descriptions, especially concerning the stages of enlightenment, the acceptance of disciples, and the Buddha's teachings. This reflects characteristics of oral transmission and a desire for thoroughness. The text primarily uses Buddhist technical terms and stock phrases rather than distinct Chinese cultural idioms. The tone is distinctly spiritual, focusing on concepts of liberation, enlightenment, karmic consequences, and the path to nirvana. Terms like '法眼淨' (purity of the Dharma-eye) and '梵行' (holy life) underscore this spiritual focus. There is no overt reinterpretation of Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The core doctrines, such as the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, are presented directly. No significant interpolations by the translator are apparent within this text excerpt beyond necessary stylistic adaptations for translation. There is no interlinear commentary within the body of the translated text. The frequent repetitions of stock phrases and doctrinal formulas, along with the sequential and often formulaic narrative style, strongly suggest an origin or transmission intended for oral recitation and memorization. No abbreviations of terms are used in the text. Subjects are often explicitly stated, even where classical Chinese might allow for omission, which makes the narrative clear and likely reflects a more literal translation approach from an Indic language.

The gatha sections consistently use lines of four characters (syllables). The language employs classical Chinese vocabulary and grammatical structures, characteristic of formal Buddhist translations of the era, rather than colloquial speech. The translation frequently exhibits repetition and adherence to a sequential, almost formulaic structure, particularly in prescriptive sections and detailed narratives (e.g., ""時世尊...作是念"" followed by actions), suggesting a close, word-for-word or phrase-for-phrase rendering of the Indic source to ensure fidelity, even if it results in less natural-sounding Chinese. The extensive detailing of monastic duties and the ordination procedures reflects a very literal and exhaustive approach. The primary goal is instructional clarity and the detailed transmission of Vinaya rules. While it uses literary Chinese, it avoids excessive embellishment or poetic flourish, opting for direct and functional language. The text is highly detailed and often repeats phrases and structures, especially when describing rules, actions, and inner thoughts of characters. This verbosity arises from the literal translation approach and the prescriptive nature of the Vinaya, ensuring every point is clearly conveyed. For example, the repeated admonitions like ""汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為"" and the extensive descriptions of duties. The text does not frequently employ Chinese idiomatic expressions or chengyu. Its language is more direct and focused on conveying the specific Buddhist teachings and rules. While a Vinaya text contains many practical rules, the overarching narrative, the descriptions of the Buddha's miraculous powers, the attainment of arhatship, the purification of the Dharma eye, and the ultimate goal of ending suffering, imbue the text with a strong spiritual tone. The use of terms like ""三昧"" alongside ""定"" also points to this. There are no overt signs in this excerpt of Buddhist concepts being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks (e.g., Daoist or Confucian terminology for core Buddhist ideas). The text maintains Buddhist specific terminology or direct calques. Without a comparative Indic text, it's difficult to confirm interpolations. However, the text's systematic and repetitive nature, typical of Vinaya, does not present obvious signs of extraneous additions. The text is presented as a continuous body of work without separate interlinear comments. The frequent use of formulaic phrases, repetitive dialogue structures, and the detailed, step-by-step nature of instructions (which would aid memorization and recitation), are characteristic of texts that have undergone or are intended for oral transmission. The narrative flow also feels like a recounted story. Names and titles are generally presented in full, or as transliterations, without significant abbreviation. Subjects of sentences, especially when actions or thoughts are attributed, are frequently and clearly stated, such as ""佛告迦葉"" or ""迦葉念言"", rather than being left implicit as often occurs in highly classical Chinese. This is likely due to literal translation from an Indic language. The character 諸 (zhū) is extensively used as a plural marker before nouns, such as ""諸比丘"" (all the monks), ""諸梵志"" (all the Brahmins), and ""諸塵垢"" (all defilements).

The translation itself is rendered in literary Chinese, employing classical vocabulary and grammatical structures rather than vernacular forms. It leans towards a literal translation, evident in the lengthy, sometimes repetitive enumerations of Buddha's epithets and samadhi types, which mirror Indic verbose styles. This literalness sometimes results in longer sentences and somewhat less fluid phrasing compared to indigenous Chinese prose, but it prioritizes fidelity to the source. The language is plain, focusing on the doctrinal content rather than elaborate literary ornamentation. The verbose nature is largely inherited from the source text's descriptive and enumerative style. There are no common Chinese idioms.

While the ultimate goal is spiritual, the method of presentation is factual and definitional. The translation strictly adheres to Indic Buddhist philosophical frameworks and terminology, without apparent reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. It explicitly references Indian Buddhist schools. No clear evidence of interpolations (additions not present in the original Indic source) is found within this section of the text. The text does not contain interlinear or marginal commentary; it presents a continuous body of translated work. The structured argumentative style (Q&A, refutations) is characteristic of a written scholastic treatise, rather than a direct transcription of an oral teaching or performance, although the content may stem from oral debates. No significant abbreviations of terms or names are used; full forms are consistently employed. While classical Chinese often allows for implicit subjects, this translation tends to make subjects explicit when necessary for clarity in its detailed philosophical arguments, especially when distinguishing between different agents or viewpoints, contributing to precision. The character 諸 (zhū) is frequently used to denote plurality (e.g., 諸佛, 諸異義, 諸法), which is a common feature in early Buddhist translations.

The translation tends towards a literal rendering, preserving the argumentative structure and technical terminology of the Indic source. This results in some repetition and a less flowing Chinese prose style, especially in the detailed expositions and enumeration of arguments, suggesting a priority for precise conceptual transmission over stylistic fluency. The language is highly functional, analytical, and technical, focused on precise definition and detailed argument, without rhetorical embellishment or ornate expressions. The Q&A format, coupled with the exhaustive exploration of various viewpoints and counter-arguments (""復有說者""), leads to verbose explanations rather than concise statements. The frequent use of ""乃至廣說"" (until extensively stated) indicates that even more detailed explanations were implicitly part of the original scope. The text primarily employs technical Buddhist vocabulary and direct explanatory language. No prominent indigenous Chinese idioms or colloquialisms are observed in the analytical portions.

The focus is on precise definitions and logical arguments concerning the nature of reality and experience, aligning with a factual, analytical approach to Buddhist teachings. The translation maintains the conceptual framework and terminology of Indian Buddhism without significant reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. Terms are either transliterated or given direct, technical Chinese equivalents. The Q&A format and the inclusion of various 'sayings' (""復有說者"") are inherent to the Vibhāṣā (commentary) genre, which systematically elaborates on a root text.

The translation exhibits a strong tendency towards literalness, often reflecting the grammatical structures and repetitive enumeration styles common in Indic (Sanskrit) Abhidharma texts. Phrases like ""所以者何"" (why is that?) are direct calques. The extensive use of categorical listings (e.g., ""應說一"", ""應說二"" up to ""應說七十二"") also points to a literal rendering of scholastic analytical methods. The language is primarily plain and functional, focused on precise definitions, classifications, and logical distinctions. It avoids rhetorical flourishes or elaborate stylistic ornamentation, fitting the analytical nature of Abhidharma. Despite using concise classical Chinese, the overall presentation is verbose due to the exhaustive categorization, repetitive question-and-answer format, and detailed elaborations for each point, which is typical of scholastic Abhidharma discourse. The text, being a technical scholastic work, does not incorporate traditional Chinese idioms (成語). The text's approach is highly analytical and systematic, dissecting Buddhist concepts (e.g., types of knowledge, mental factors, states of meditation) with precision and classification, characteristic of Abhidharma literature. The focus is on a technical, 'factual' understanding of spiritual phenomena. There is no evidence within the text of Buddhist teachings being interpreted or recontextualized through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts (e.g., Daoism, Confucianism). The discourse strictly adheres to Indian Buddhist scholastic frameworks. The text maintains a consistent scholastic style, with internal debates and differing opinions (e.g., ""復有說者"", ""評曰"") presented as part of the original Abhidharma tradition rather than later Chinese additions. No extraneous material is evident that would suggest an interpolation by the Chinese translators. No comments or explanations are placed between the lines of the main text. All explanatory content is integrated into the main body of the discourse. The pervasive question-and-answer format, the frequent use of ""如先說"" (as said before), and the referencing of different scholarly opinions (""復有說者"") suggest a style influenced by oral exposition, debate, and a tradition of transmitted knowledge, characteristic of early Buddhist scholasticism. The text uses standard Buddhist terminology without employing abbreviations. Consistent with classical Chinese style and literal translation, sentence subjects are frequently omitted when context allows, leading to an implicit subject. The character 諸 (zhū) is extensively used before nouns to indicate plurality or generality (e.g., 諸餘心數, 諸地, 諸比丘, 諸法). Tense is not explicitly marked grammatically but is inferred from context or the use of temporal indicators. This aligns with the typical structure of classical Chinese.",

It would employ precise technical terminology for exhaustive classification and definition of philosophical and psychological concepts, leading to a verbose and precise style. Translation style evaluation: 1.  **Verse, prose, or mixed**: The text is presented entirely in continuous prose, structured as a systematic question-and-answer dialogue, which is characteristic of Abhidharma scholasticism. 2.  **Syllables per line**: 0. This metric is not applicable as the text is in prose. 3.  **Vernacular or literary**: The translation employs classical Chinese grammar and vocabulary, typical of formal Buddhist sutra and śāstra translations from the Northern Liang period, indicating a literary rather than a vernacular style. 4.  **Literal or fluent**: The translation leans towards a literal rendering. It closely follows the logical structure and technical vocabulary of the Indic original, often resulting in repetitive phrasing (e.g., repeated questions and answers) and a somewhat stiff or direct sentence construction that prioritizes precise transmission of the original meaning over natural Chinese fluency. This is common in early, technical scholastic translations. 5.  **Ornate or plain language**: The language is distinctly plain and functional. It avoids rhetorical flourishes, poetic imagery, or ornate descriptions, focusing solely on the clear and systematic explanation of Abhidharma concepts. 6.  **Terse or verbose wording**: The text is verbose. The extensive use of a question-and-answer format, coupled with the systematic exploration of numerous permutations and conditions (e.g., past/future/present knowledge, various states of attainment, presence/absence of cessation), leads to considerable repetition and detailed elaboration, aiming for exhaustive logical completeness. 7.  **Idioms used**: No distinct Chinese idioms are present. The language maintains a technical and direct tone throughout. 8.  **Factual or spiritual**: The tone is factual and analytical. It systematically defines and categorizes mental states and types of knowledge (e.g., 'other-minds-knowledge' 他心智, 'knowledge of phenomena' 法智), and discusses the conditions for their 'achievement' (成就) or 'being currently present' (現在前). The focus is on the logical and definitional aspects of these concepts rather than subjective spiritual experience or devotional elements. 9.  **Indigenous Chinese interpretations**: There is no evidence that Buddhist teachings have been reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The translation maintains the original Indic scholastic framework and terminology, consistent with the translator's stated aim in the preface to ""strive for the original meaning"" and ""remove verbosity to get to the truth."" 10. **Interpolations**: The text adheres strictly to the Abhidharma question-and-answer format. There are no apparent significant textual additions or changes to the doctrinal content by the translators within the main body of the text. 11. **Interlinear commentary**: The text is presented as a continuous block of main text without any smaller script or commentary inserted between the lines. 12. **Oral transmission signs**: While ancient translations involved oral aspects, the written text itself does not exhibit specific stylistic markers of direct oral transcription, such as conversational speech patterns, direct addresses to an audience within the main body, or rhetorical devices primarily designed for live oral delivery. 13. **Abbreviations**: No explicit abbreviations in terms of shortened words or phrases are used within the technical or general language of the text. Terms are consistently presented in full. 14. **Implicit or explicit sentence subjects**: While explicit subjects are used when necessary for clarity (e.g., '若學人' - if a trainee), the text frequently omits subjects when they can be readily inferred from context, especially within the consistent question-and-answer structure. Therefore, the overall tendency leans towards implicit subjects. 15. **Plural '諸' (zhū)**: The adverb 諸 (zhū) is not used to indicate plural forms of nouns within the main translated text. Plurality, when intended for general categories, is indicated by terms such as '一切眾生' (all sentient beings). 16. **Tense indication**: Tense is explicitly indicated through the systematic use of specific temporal terms: '過去' (past), '現在' (present), and '未來' (future) when discussing the states and achievements of various types of knowledge.",

The translation often adheres closely to the structure of the Indic source, resulting in a somewhat literal style with some repetitions and less fluid Chinese phrasing compared to native literary works. The language is largely direct and functional, focusing on conveying doctrinal content rather than aesthetic embellishment, despite the grand subject matter. The prose sections, particularly the enumerations of worlds, Buddhas, bodhisattva qualities, and offerings, are very extensive and repetitive, making the style verbose. The verse sections are naturally more concise. No prominent indigenous Chinese idioms (成語) are observed; the phrasing is generally a direct rendition of Indic concepts. The terminology (e.g., samadhi 三昧, bodhisattva 菩薩, Tathagata 如來, Dharma-body 法身) and content overwhelmingly concern spiritual states, attainments, and Buddhist doctrine. There is no overt interpretation of Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts (e.g., Daoist or Confucian frameworks) in this text, which is typical for Buddhabhadra's translation style. It is difficult to definitively identify interpolations without comparison to an Indic source text; however, the style of extensive enumeration and repetition is characteristic of the source tradition itself rather than external additions. No interlinear commentary is present in the provided text. The frequent use of formulaic phrases (e.g., 爾時, 善男子) and extensive enumerations, especially in the gathas and prose lists, suggests elements that could facilitate oral recitation and memorization.

There are no obvious indigenous Chinese idioms or philosophical concepts used to interpret Buddhist teachings; the focus remains on Buddhist cosmology and karma. No interpolations or interlinear commentary are apparent. Signs of oral transmission are strong, indicated by the repetitive narrative structure ('Buddha tells Ananda: What is called X hell? X hell is...') and formulaic descriptions of hells and their karmic causes. Sentence subjects are often explicitly stated, particularly when introducing new entities or actions, though classical Chinese patterns of omission are also present. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is frequently used to indicate plural forms.

The descriptions are highly ornate and verbose, focusing on elaborate visual details of Buddhas, lights, and transformations to convey a spiritual and miraculous tone. No indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts are used to interpret the Buddhist teachings. There is no interlinear commentary or abbreviations. The narrative style, with direct addresses like '佛告阿難' and repetitive descriptions, suggests characteristics of oral transmission.

Despite some vivid and descriptive language, the overall style leans towards plainness in its narrative function rather than elaborate literary embellishment. The text is verbose, characterized by detailed and extensive descriptions of miraculous events, transformations, and enumerations of spiritual beings and powers. While relying heavily on classical Chinese, some idioms and vivid similes are used. The tone is distinctly spiritual, focusing on the Buddha's miraculous powers, spiritual attainments (samadhi), and the path to liberation. There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts; instead, Indic terms and concepts are largely preserved through transliteration and direct translation. The text contains no obvious interpolations or interlinear commentary. The frequent use of '佛告阿難' (Buddha tells Ananda) and the extended narrative style strongly suggest a text originating from or adapted for oral transmission. No clear abbreviations are used. Sentence subjects are frequently stated explicitly, especially when characters or speakers change, to maintain clarity in the complex narrative, which is a common practice in literal translations of Indic texts.

The narrative is quite verbose, often repeating concepts and emphasizing points through extensive description and enumeration of benefits. The descriptions of Buddhas, light, and transformations are rich and grand, but the overall language style remains direct and functional rather than overly ornate with complex metaphors or poetic devices. The frequent use of '諸' (zhu) for pluralization and the reliance on context and temporal markers rather than explicit verb conjugations for tense are typical features. The presence of repetitive phrases (e.g., ""善哉善哉"", ""諦聽諦聽"") and formulaic addresses is a strong indicator of influence from oral transmission traditions. Buddhist terminology such as '三昧' (samādhi) is consistently used, reflecting a spiritual rather than strictly factual tone.

This is particularly evident in the systematic enumeration of steps and states, which might be a direct translation of an Indic list-based style. While the language is classical Chinese and not modern vernacular, it generally favors clear and direct exposition of Buddhist doctrines and meditative practices. It avoids excessive literary embellishments or highly metaphorical language, prioritizing the precise conveyance of complex spiritual concepts. The text is verbose, characterized by extensive repetition of concepts, detailed enumerations of various states (e.g., ""退分"", ""住分"", ""升進分"", ""決定分""), and multiple examples or descriptions for each point. This is common in pedagogical texts designed for thorough instruction. The text's primary focus is on spiritual practice and the attainment of meditative states (禪智, 三昧). While it describes these practices in a structured manner, the underlying purpose and terminology (e.g., ""三昧"" for meditation, descriptions of heavenly and hellish realms) are distinctly spiritual. The translation introduces Buddhist concepts directly, often using transliterations or newly coined Chinese terms, without apparent attempts to systematically equate them with existing indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts (e.g., Daoist or Confucian ideas). The explicit note ""(梵本中無此一偈)"" at [0314b10] confirms the presence of at least one interpolation in the text, indicating that additions not found in the Sanskrit original were included. Numerous short explanatory notes are interspersed within the main text, usually enclosed in parentheses, to clarify specific terms, phrases, or provide additional context.

The text exhibits characteristics consistent with oral transmission, such as frequent repetition of phrases and formulaic structures, particularly in the verse sections. This pedagogical style suggests a background in teaching and memorization. The text does not employ abbreviations in the sense of shortened forms of words or acronyms. Terms are generally presented in full, even when they are transliterations from Sanskrit. Like much classical Chinese writing, the text frequently omits sentence subjects when they can be inferred from context, making the subjects implicit rather than explicitly stated in every clause. The character 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plural forms, such as in ""諸佛"" (all Buddhas) and ""諸修行"" (all practitioners).

The extensive use of epithets for the Buddha, often listed together, also reflects Indic literary conventions. Philosophical discussions, particularly those concerning concepts like 'self' (我), 'impermanence' (無常), 'suffering' (苦), and 'emptiness' (空), are distinctly Buddhist and originate from Indic thought. The use of analogies and parables to illustrate complex points is also a common feature of Buddhist discourse in Indic languages.Translation Style: The translation employs classical (literary) Chinese, reflecting the standard practice for formal religious texts of the era.

The extensive repetition of introductory phrases like ""佛住舍衛城，廣說如上"" (The Buddha resided in Sāvatthī city, extensively explained as above) and detailed enumerations contribute to a 'verbose' style, despite some individual sentences being concise. The phrase ""廣說如上"" also serves as an abbreviation. The presence of a short verse section (5 syllables per line) indicates a 'mixed' prose and verse format, although the bulk is prose. The explanatory gloss ""(生疎也)"" functions as both an interlinear commentary and an interpolation.

The language style is closer to early Buddhist vernacular Chinese (早期白話), characterized by relatively simple sentence structures and direct vocabulary, rather than highly ornate classical literary Chinese. It aims for clarity and accessibility. The translation shows strong characteristics of a literal style (直譯). This is evident in the frequent use of formulaic repetitions (e.g., ""佛言：「呼…來。」來已，佛問比丘：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾世尊！」"") which closely mirror Indic narrative patterns, as well as sometimes slightly unidiomatic Chinese phrasing that reflects the source language structure. The language is consistently plain and functional, prioritizing the clear transmission of monastic rules and their narrative contexts over literary embellishment or stylistic flourish. The text is verbose. Each rule is introduced with a detailed narrative (緣起, nidāna) explaining the circumstances of its establishment, often with repetitive phrases. The account of the First Council is particularly extensive. The text does not employ indigenous Chinese idioms. The language is direct and primarily concerned with conveying Buddhist concepts and regulations. While the rules themselves are factual regulations for monastic conduct, the terminology used for spiritual states, such as ""三昧"" (samādhi), and the overall context of seeking enlightenment and spiritual liberation, lead to categorization as ""spiritual."" The Vinaya serves a spiritual purpose through practical rules. The text largely maintains Indic Buddhist concepts and terminology, showing no significant reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts like Daoism or Confucianism. The lineage of transmission presented at the end of the text (從尊者道力聞...優波離授陀娑婆羅...) is a feature often added by Chinese redactors or during the transmission process to establish the authenticity and continuity of the Dharma, and can be considered an interpolation from the perspective of the original Indic text's core content. There is no explicit interlinear or marginal commentary present in the provided text. The highly formulaic and repetitive narrative patterns, particularly the consistent structure for introducing new rules and dialogues, strongly indicate an origin in oral transmission and a design for memorization. The text frequently uses formulaic abbreviations such as ""乃至佛言"" (""...up to the Buddha saying"") to condense standard narrative sequences, indicating an abridged form of reporting common in Buddhist scriptures. While classical Chinese often allows for implicit subjects, this translation frequently includes explicit subjects (e.g., ""佛言"", ""比丘答言"", ""比丘即以手摩額上""). This tendency likely reflects a more direct translation style from Indic languages, which typically require explicit subjects.

The translation style is very literal, evident in its highly repetitive narrative structure for presenting each rule (e.g., constant recounting of the setting, the incident, reporting to the Buddha, Buddha's inquiry, and then the rule), and its consistent use of stock phrases and cross-references (e.g., ""如上說"", ""乃至已聞者當重聞""). This indicates a close adherence to the source's form and content. The language is plain and functional, prioritizing clarity and directness in conveying monastic rules and their circumstances, without employing elaborate literary devices or embellishments. The text is verbose due to the extensive repetition of formulaic phrases in each incident's narrative (e.g., the repeated sequence of '佛住舍衛城...', '諸比丘尼語大愛道...', '大愛道往白世尊...', '佛言：「呼是比丘尼來。」來已問言：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」佛言：「此是惡事...」') and detailed, often redundant, explanations or definitions following each rule. No distinct Chinese idioms are employed; the language is a direct translation of Buddhist legalistic discourse. The text is a Vinaya (monastic discipline) text, focusing on the practical and legalistic aspects of monastic life, rules, and transgressions. Terms used (e.g., 波夜提 for offense, 受具足 for ordination) are factual and procedural rather than explicitly spiritual or mystical. The translation does not appear to reinterpret Buddhist concepts using indigenous Chinese philosophical terminology or frameworks; it largely maintains Buddhist-specific vocabulary and concepts.

The prose sections do not adhere to a fixed syllable count. The language is written in a formal, literary Chinese style characteristic of early Buddhist translations, employing classical particles and structures (""如是我聞"", ""爾時"", ""善男子"", ""何以故"", ""云何""), and is not vernacular Chinese. The translation exhibits a tendency towards literalism, evidenced by repetitive phrasing, direct transliteration of many Indic terms and names, and sentence structures that sometimes mirror Indic syntax rather than natural flowing Chinese. The detailed enumerations and explanations are also very direct. The language is primarily plain and functional, focused on conveying narrative and doctrine using standard Buddhist terminology. It avoids elaborate literary flourishes or complex metaphors, adhering to a clear and direct presentation. The text is verbose, characterized by extensive repetition of phrases (e.g., groups arriving and performing the same actions), detailed enumerations (like the list of dharanis, 24 precepts), and lengthy explanations of concepts or names (e.g., the multiple interpretations of ""婆萸""). No distinct indigenous Chinese idioms or established chengyu are observed; the language is predominantly functional in conveying Buddhist concepts. The text explicitly uses spiritual terms such as ""三昧"" (samādhi), ""法眼淨"", ""無生法忍"", ""阿羅漢果"", ""辟支佛心"", and speaks of spiritual attainments and liberation, indicating a spiritual tone. Buddhist teachings are presented using transliterated Indic terms and concepts, without apparent reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks (e.g., Daoism or Confucianism). The explanation of the name ""婆萸"" uses Chinese characters to describe its meaning, but these interpretations remain within a Buddhist context. No clear interpolations (additions not present in the source text) are discernible without comparative textual analysis; the verbosity and detailed explanations are interpreted as part of the translation style reflecting the source, rather than extraneous additions. The dharani sections include interlinear numbering (e.g., ""(一)"", ""(二)"") to mark phrases and occasionally break down pronunciations, indicating a form of interlinear commentary or guidance for recitation. The text begins with the formula ""如是我聞"" (Thus have I heard), a hallmark of texts originating from an oral tradition. The extensive use of repetition throughout the narrative also suggests a style suited for oral recitation and memorization. No significant abbreviations of terms are used beyond common shortened forms for Buddhist figures (e.g., ""佛"" for ""佛陀"") which are not typically counted as abbreviations in this context. Names and concepts are generally spelled out or transliterated in full.

The translation exhibits a tendency towards literal rendering, often following Indic syntax. This can be seen in repetitive phrases and somewhat unnatural (for Chinese) sentence structures, indicating a close adherence to the source. The language is generally straightforward and focuses on conveying doctrinal information without excessive ornamentation or flowery descriptions. The text can be quite verbose due to repetitions of names, titles, and full phrases (e.g., ""阿耨多羅三藐三菩提成一切智"") rather than using pronouns or shorter references, a characteristic often found in literal translations from Sanskrit. No distinct Chinese idioms are readily apparent, which is typical for early Buddhist translations that prioritize faithful rendering of the source text. The text's terminology and narrative emphasize spiritual concepts, attainments (like '無生法忍' - the patience of no-birth), and the soteriological power of the Dharma and Buddhas, rather than purely factual descriptions. Buddhist concepts are presented using their own transliterations and direct semantic translations, without apparent reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks (e.g., Daoism or Confucianism). No obvious interpolations by the Chinese translator are discernible in the text's style. The narrative flow appears consistent with a translation. The text does not contain any interlinear notes or commentaries. The frequent use of direct address (e.g., ""善男子"", ""阿難""), call-and-response dialogues, and narrative repetitions suggests characteristics of an orally transmitted or delivered discourse, even without the explicit ""如是我聞"" formula. Names and key Buddhist terms are consistently written out in full, rather than abbreviated. Sentence subjects are frequently stated explicitly, which can sometimes make the Chinese sound less natural compared to native Classical Chinese, where subjects are often omitted.

While there are poetic elements and elevated vocabulary befitting the subject matter (e.g., '慧燈除冥', '金剛之大柱'), it avoids excessive embellishment or complex literary devices for stylistic flourish. The translation style is notably literal, often reflecting the structure and word choice of the Indic original rather than prioritizing a completely natural Chinese flow. This is common in early Buddhist translations and can be seen in direct renderings of technical terms and sometimes slightly less idiomatic phrasing.

The provided text block does not include any interlinear commentary. The presence of the ""如是我聞"" (Thus have I heard) opening, extensive dialogue, and some repetitive phrasing (e.g., lists of attributes, call-and-response questions) are indicative of an oral transmission tradition that has been committed to writing. No abbreviations of names or common phrases are utilized in the text; terms and titles are consistently rendered in full.

The style is direct and functional, prioritizing clarity and adherence to the Vinaya rules rather than rhetorical embellishment. The presentation of Vinaya rules and the narrative descriptions are generally concise and to the point, avoiding excessive elaboration. The text does not contain a significant number of classical Chinese idioms; its language is more technical and descriptive. As a Vinaya text, it focuses on the factual establishment and enforcement of monastic regulations and narratives of events, using precise, practical terminology even when discussing spiritual practices. There is no apparent reinterpretation of Buddhist doctrines or terminology through the lens of native Chinese philosophies such as Daoism or Confucianism. The translation maintains distinct Buddhist concepts. Without a comparative study with the original Indic text or other translations, it is not possible to definitively identify interpolations within this version; the narrative flow appears consistent. The provided text does not feature any interlinear notes or commentaries. The repetitive question-and-answer patterns, particularly in the sections detailing Vinaya rules and the Buddha's pronouncements, are suggestive of a style adapted from oral instruction and transmission. No discernible abbreviations are used beyond the natural conciseness of classical Chinese. While classical Chinese often allows for implicit subjects, this translation frequently includes explicit subjects (e.g., ""諸比丘"", ""王"", ""世尊"") to maintain clarity, especially in the context of legalistic rules and changing actors. The character 諸 (zhū) is consistently and widely used to pluralize nouns (e.g., 諸比丘, 諸釋, 諸相師, 諸居士). Tense in the Chinese translation is primarily conveyed through temporal adverbs (e.g., ""爾時"", ""後"", ""先"") and contextual cues, rather than through explicit verb conjugations.",

The translation style is quite literal, often reflecting the structure of the Indic original, which can sometimes result in less fluid Chinese phrasing, particularly in the detailed enumeration of rules. The language is plain and functional, as is typical for Vinaya texts, rather than ornate. The verbose nature stems from the detailed recounting of narratives (nidāna) that precede each rule (e.g., stories of Devadatta and past lives), and the meticulous enumeration of conditions for rules, which is characteristic of Vinaya literature. While classical Chinese often implies sentence subjects, this translation frequently makes them explicit, especially in dialogue and rule statements, for clarity.

The translation exhibits a 'literal' approach, often retaining the repetitive narrative structure of the Indic source (e.g., '諸比丘以是白佛，佛言...'). This repetitive framing of each rule or incident makes the text overall 'verbose', despite individual rules sometimes being terse. The language is 'plain', devoid of ornate descriptions.

Therefore, the text as a whole is classified as 'mixed'. For the 'syllables_per_line' field, a value of 0 is given because, while some parts are structured, they do not conform to a consistent or intentional syllable count per line typical of Chinese poetry.

The translation style is predominantly literal, prioritizing direct correspondence with the Indic source, even at the expense of fluency sometimes. This is evident in the direct rendering of Sanskrit terms (e.g., 旃陀羅 caṇḍāla, 毘尼 Vinaya) and the phonetic transcription of dharanis. The language is literary Chinese, using classical grammatical structures rather than vernacular forms. The wording is generally terse, conveying information concisely without excessive elaboration.

For instance, the sequential descriptions of 'seeing one' then 'seeing two' (見一已見二) are directly translated stylistic features from the source. The language is literary Chinese, using classical forms rather than vernacular, and employs plain language without ornate embellishments. The tone of the instructions is factual, detailing specific visual and somatic experiences during meditation (e.g., observing bodily decomposition, elemental transformations) rather than focusing on abstract spiritual concepts. While the ultimate goal is spiritual liberation, the meditative path is described with a clinical, observational approach. There are no apparent Chinese idioms or indigenous Chinese philosophical interpretations. The text lacks interlinear commentary and significant abbreviations. The frequent use of repetitive phrases and enumerations (e.g., '如是我聞', '諦聽諦聽', sequential instruction) is a strong indicator of its origin in or suitability for oral transmission.

The language is plain, focusing on clarity of instruction and description for visualization, not on ornate literary embellishment. The text is verbose, with extensive repetitions and detailed enumerations of meditation objects and stages, a characteristic often found in early Buddhist texts reflecting their oral origins. Idioms in the common Chinese sense are not prominently used; the text focuses on precise Buddhist terminology. The tone is spiritual, as it details meditation practices (觀身不淨, 數息, 觀佛三昧) aimed at achieving spiritual insights and liberation (e.g., arhatship, seeing Buddhas), using terms like '甘露' (amṛta) and '三昧' (samādhi).

The language is literary, using formal vocabulary and classical Chinese grammatical structures, but it aims for plainness in conveying the doctrines rather than ornate embellishment. The text is verbose, providing detailed, step-by-step guidance. While many instructional sentences directed at the practitioner employ implicit subjects, the narrative sections and dialogues consistently use explicit subjects for clarity. Tense is explicitly indicated through temporal markers such as '爾時' (at that time), '乃往過去' (long ago in the past), and '未來世' (future world). The pluralizer '諸' is frequently used.

This contributes to a verbose style, marked by frequent repetition of phrases, descriptive lists, and detailed accounts, rather than terse wording. The language used to describe Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and celestial phenomena is rich in imagery and highly descriptive, making it ornate. There is no significant use of indigenous Chinese idioms.

This focus on phonetic and semantic fidelity points to a literal translation approach. The tone is deeply spiritual, focusing on advanced Buddhist doctrines and the subtle interpretation of 'secret language' (密語) by Manjushri, which clarifies Buddhist concepts within their original philosophical framework rather than reinterpreting them through indigenous Chinese philosophies. The repetitive phrasing for narrative descriptions and ritual actions, along with direct address formulas like '阿難當知！' (Ananda, you should know!), are characteristic features suggesting elements of oral transmission.

The translation employs a classical/literary Chinese style, typical of early Buddhist scriptures, distinct from contemporary spoken vernacular, with formal vocabulary and syntax. It tends towards a literal rendering of the Indic source, characterized by frequent repetitions of lists and formulaic phrases, which can result in a somewhat repetitive or stiff sentence structure from a native Chinese perspective, but ensures doctrinal accuracy. The language is functional and direct, focused on conveying doctrinal concepts clearly, without elaborate literary devices. While some individual phrases are concise, the overall style is verbose due to extensive and repeated enumerations of categories and full recitation of formulaic passages, likely reflecting the source text's style. The text utilizes specialized Buddhist terminology and fixed doctrinal phrases rather than general, culturally specific Chinese idioms. The primary focus is on the analysis of suffering, its causes, cessation, and the path to liberation (涅槃), which are fundamentally spiritual goals. There is no significant evidence of Buddhist concepts being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks. The text does not contain interpolations in the sense of unauthorized additions to the Buddha's discourses; notes like '廣說' (elaborated upon) are editorial remarks indicating where repetitive content from the source text has been condensed. There is no interlinear commentary. The prevalent use of repetitive formulas, set phrases, and structured enumerations is a strong indicator of an oral transmission tradition. While the translation uses phrases like '乃至' (up to/and so on) to indicate the continuation of a list, these are not abbreviations of individual words or concepts.

The translation employs a form of literary Chinese, distinct from colloquial vernacular. It aims for a clear, if somewhat formal, presentation of the dharma, rather than highly stylized indigenous classical prose. The translation exhibits a relatively literal approach, often mirroring the syntax and repetitive structures of the Indic source language. This can sometimes result in Chinese that is less idiomatic but faithful to the original's phrasing. Examples include formulaic openings and repeated phrases. The language is plain and direct, prioritizing the clear conveyance of Buddhist concepts and narratives over literary embellishment or ornate expressions. The text is verbose, employing repetitive phrases and detailed explanations, particularly in the prose sections. This reflects the oral tradition of the source texts, where repetition served as a mnemonic device and for emphasis. The use of ""廣說如上"" (as extensively said above) to condense repeated sections implicitly acknowledges the verbose nature of the original.

While advice on daily life is practical, its ultimate aim is spiritual well-being and enlightenment. The translation generally avoids reinterpreting Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. It attempts to render the Indic concepts as directly as possible, sometimes leading to unique ""translationese"" rather than a full sinicization of ideas.

No interlinear commentary is present in the provided text. The presence of highly formulaic openings, repeated phrases, standardized narrative structures for dialogues and events, and the inclusion of gathas summarizing prose discussions are strong indicators of a text originating from or influenced by an oral transmission tradition. No abbreviations of words or terms are used within the translated content; the note ""廣說如上"" is a compilation strategy rather than an abbreviation within the text itself. While classical Chinese often allows for implicit subjects, this translation frequently employs explicit sentence subjects, particularly when introducing speakers or actions in narrative and dialogue, reflecting a more direct translation style from Indic languages. Implicit subjects appear in contexts where they are unambiguous. The particle 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plural forms (e.g., ""諸婆羅門,"" ""諸沙門、婆羅門,"" ""諸眾生"").

This suggests a literal translation style, aiming to preserve the structure and content of the Indic original, possibly at the expense of a more fluent Chinese literary style. The language is plain and direct, not ornate. The verbose nature stems from the extensive repetition across many short, similarly structured pericopes (suttas).

It uses literary Chinese, employing classical particles and a formal tone. Despite the subject matter being ornate descriptions of Tusita Heaven, the language style itself is plain and direct in its enumeration, rather than florid. The text is verbose due to its detailed descriptions. It is overtly spiritual in tone and content, using terms like '三昧'. There is no clear evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. Subjects are frequently explicitly stated in the narrative.

The content focuses on diagnosing and treating various physical and mental afflictions arising during meditation practice, using vivid imagery and detailed instructions. The source text primarily uses prose for narrative and instructional portions, interspersed with verse sections (gathas), which consistently have five syllables per line. The translation itself is rendered in a literary Chinese style, typical of early Buddhist translations, and leans towards a literal approach. This literalism is evident in the direct and sometimes repetitive phrasing of instructions and descriptions, aiming for fidelity to the source rather than flowing natural Chinese prose. The language, while descriptive and rich in imagery for spiritual and physiological states, prioritizes functional clarity over ornate literary embellishment. The verbose nature is demonstrated through extensive and detailed explanations of symptoms, meditative remedies, and visionary experiences. The text incorporates several Chinese idioms, contributing to its expression. The overarching tone is spiritual, centered on the attainment of samadhi and overcoming obstacles to spiritual liberation, even when describing seemingly factual bodily phenomena. There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. Parenthetical notes (e.g., '(是名治亂倒心法)') are present within the main text, serving as explanatory additions that function as interpolations. The text does not feature physically separate interlinear commentary. Indicators like '如是我聞' and frequent direct addresses to '舍利弗' suggest a context of oral transmission.

The style of the translation leans towards a literal rendering of the source Indic language, resulting in some phrasing that might feel less fluent to a native Chinese speaker. While descriptive, the language used is generally plain rather than overly ornate in its prose. The content is verbose, with detailed descriptions of symptoms, visions, and prescribed cures. The tone is distinctly spiritual, employing numerous Buddhist technical terms and concepts from Indic Buddhism, such as samādhi (三昧), bodhicitta (菩提心), and various deities and visions. There is no significant reinterpretation of Buddhist teachings according to indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. Interlinear commentary is present, providing explanations for certain terms (e.g., 旃陀羅摩尼 (月精), 藹吉支 (起尸鬼)). Signs of oral transmission are evident in the formulaic openings and repetitive phrases.

It combines both prose and verse sections. While many verse sections maintain a four-syllable line structure, especially in initial gathas, the longer narrative verse passages predominantly use a five-syllable line structure. The language is literary, utilizing classical Chinese grammatical structures and vocabulary. The translation style is explicitly indicated as 'literal' by the translator's name '功德直譯' (Gṛddhakuṭa, 'literal translator'). This literalness is evident in the retention of Indic narrative patterns, such as extensive repetitions (e.g., the same event described in both prose and verse) and detailed enumerations of lists (e.g., names of devas, characteristics of a city), which contribute to a verbose style from a Chinese perspective. Phrases that appear slightly unnatural in Chinese, like '善脫無脫，深知無知,' are likely direct renderings of Sanskrit literary devices, indicating a lack of introduced native Chinese idioms. The use of transliterated Sanskrit terms like '三昧' (samādhi) for meditation suggests a spiritual rather than purely factual tone. There is no overt reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks. The text does not contain interlinear commentary or apparent interpolations. The repetitive nature of certain passages and the use of gathas are strong indicators of a style designed for oral transmission.

The text presents a mixed style, alternating between prose and five-syllable verse (gāthā) sections. This mixed style, with verses often summarizing or reiterating the prose, is characteristic of Indic Buddhist literature and suggests an origin in oral transmission for the source text. The language used is literary Chinese, employing a formal and elevated register with descriptive adjectives, making it ornate rather than plain. The prose sections, in particular, tend to be verbose due to extensive listings and repetitions of terms and phrases. Indigenous Chinese idioms are rarely used. The tone is spiritual, focusing on the Buddha's transcendental qualities and employing terms like '三昧' (samādhi). There is no significant reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophical lenses. A clear instance of interlinear commentary is observed at line 0808c27 (此或言施戒法，世間皆無慳義).

Its style is characterized by extensive enumerations, negations (e.g., 'not X, not not X'), and repetitive phrasing common in Indic Buddhist literature, aimed at comprehensive coverage of spiritual concepts. The translation maintains a 'literal' approach, striving to render the source text's structure and terminology accurately into 'literary' Chinese. This often results in a 'verbose' style, particularly in the explanatory prose, and the retention of a 'plain' rather than ornate language. Subjects are frequently 'implicit' in the classical Chinese style, though explicitly stated when changing focus. The use of '諸' (zhu) for plurals is a consistent feature. The presence of interlinear phonetic glosses for the dhāraṇī indicates a dedication to precise transliteration for practice. The spiritual nature of the source material is fully conveyed, using terms like '三昧' (samādhi). By the Song dynasty, Buddhist terminology was well-established, and the translation does not appear to reinterpret teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. There are no obvious interpolations or abbreviations, nor signs of an oral transmission style beyond the standard '如是我聞'. Tense is generally 'unspecified', relying on temporal markers and context.",
十誦羯磨,T 1439,mixed,5,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,factual,False,True,True,True,explicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The source text is primarily a monastic legal (Vinaya) text detailing various ordination and communal procedures (羯磨). Its style is highly formulaic, repetitive, and prescriptive. The translation closely adheres to this, resulting in a literal, somewhat stiff Chinese. It frequently transliterates Sanskrit terms directly and employs a formal, somewhat archaic literary Chinese style. There are clear interpolations by the Chinese compiler/editor, notably explanatory notes in parentheses that clarify the context or procedure for the Chinese reader. The strong emphasis on call-and-response and repeated formulas suggests an original oral/recitational context and a translation intended for similar performance. The language is practical and instructional rather than ornate or philosophical in its presentation of the rules. Tense is generally unspecified, focusing on the actions as they occur in the ritual, though past and future markers appear for specific points. The use of 諸 (zhu) for plurals is consistent for monastic groups and revered figures.

The tone is spiritual, as the stories serve to illustrate Buddhist moral and karmic principles, despite being presented in a narrative, factual manner. There is a strong emphasis on filial piety (孝順), indicating an interpretation or adaptation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. As a 'storehouse' (雜寶藏) of tales, it likely contains interpolations, possibly of Chinese origin or significant adaptation.

It is functional and direct, generally avoiding highly ornate classical structures, yet it is not vernacular in a modern sense. The translation exhibits a tendency towards literalness, which can result in some repetition of phrases (e.g., ""何以極少？何以極小？"") and a less fluent, sometimes clunky, flow when compared to original Chinese prose. This is a common feature of early translations from Indic languages, aiming to preserve original meaning even at the expense of stylistic naturalness in Chinese. The translation can be verbose, partly due to its literal adherence to the source and repetition of ideas or phrases, as seen in the dialogue with the mendicant where the same question about ""few/small"" is repeated multiple times. Few distinct Chinese idioms are used; the language is generally straightforward. The text's overall tone is spiritual, focusing on Buddhist concepts of merit, karma, liberation (e.g., Srotapanna, Arhat), and enlightenment, rather than purely factual or secular descriptions. There is no overt evidence in this text of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted using indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts (e.g., Daoist or Confucian terms used as direct equivalents for core Buddhist ideas), though some conceptual overlap is naturally present. No clear internal textual evidence suggests interpolations within the narrative flow. Repetitive phrasing and formulaic expressions (e.g., ""爾時"" and recurring descriptions of monastic actions) are present, which are characteristic features often associated with texts that have undergone a period of oral transmission.

The text employs several traditional Chinese idioms and vivid metaphors to enhance descriptions and arguments, such as ""草芥群生"" (despise all living beings) or ""藕絲懸須彌山"" (an impossible task). It is challenging to definitively identify interpolations without the original Indic text. However, the lengthy and specific anecdotal stories, such as King Kaniṣka's detailed recounting of his ""two and a half"" sins and the accompanying legends, could suggest narrative elaborations or integrations of popular tales that might not have been in the earliest Indic version. The text exhibits characteristics of oral transmission, such as repetitive phrases, especially in the lineage descriptions (""...次付...轉復囑累..."") and the inclusion of verses introduced by ""說偈讚曰"" within the prose, indicating recited sections. While subjects are sometimes explicit, particularly when introducing new actors, the text frequently omits sentence subjects when they can be inferred from context, a common feature of classical Chinese grammar.

This repetitive style is indicative of an oral tradition, aiding memorization and emphasizing core spiritual teachings. The use of vivid analogies (water foam, bubbles, mirage, banana tree, illusion) is a common pedagogical method in early Buddhist discourse to convey spiritual insights. Translation Style: This translation, done by Zhu Tanwulan during the Eastern Jin dynasty, is distinctly literal. It closely follows the structure and phrasing of the Indic original, often resulting in verbose and somewhat stiff Chinese, with frequent repetition of entire phrases (e.g., ""彼有目士諦觀察之思惟分別。彼人見已諦觀察之思惟分別，空無所有，無來無往，亦不堅固"").

While the language leans towards literary Chinese, it prioritizes the direct conveyance of spiritual doctrine over ornate literary embellishment. The prose is generally terse, and sentence subjects are often implicit, relying on context. The repetition of phrases and call-and-response dialogue patterns are strong indicators of an underlying oral transmission from the source text. Although not a systematic reinterpretation, the translation incorporates vocabulary that resonates with indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts, such as the use of '道' for Buddhist teachings and emphasis on '孝親' (filial piety), facilitating early Chinese understanding.

While mostly fluent, there are occasional phrasings that might hint at a more literal rendering from the Indic original. The prose uses a relatively plain style, while the verse is also direct. Indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts, particularly Confucian filial piety, are notably interwoven into the interpretation of the narrative's moral lessons, as seen in the son's internal struggle over avenging his father. The presence of the 'Thus have I heard' formula and direct address from the Buddha, along with the storytelling format, suggests a style rooted in oral transmission. The concluding verse section, distinct from the narrative, is likely an interpolation common in early sutra structures. Plurality is often indicated by '諸'. Tense is primarily inferred from context and temporal adverbs.",

It is rendered in prose, employing a relatively direct and plain vernacular Chinese for its time, aiming for clarity over ornate embellishment. The translation style is largely literal, directly translating terms and concepts, which can sometimes result in less fluent phrasing. While aiming for directness, the explanations provided within the text are sufficiently thorough, leading to a balance between conciseness and verbosity. A significant feature is the influence of indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts, particularly Daoist thought, in interpreting Buddhist doctrines, as evidenced by the use of terms like '道' (Dao) and '無為' (wuwei), and the concluding discussion on '空' (emptiness) with language resonating with Daoist notions of 'wu' (nothingness) and 'ziran' (spontaneity).

It is plain and direct, focusing on conveying the teachings rather than ornate embellishment, and the explanations are generally terse. There are no readily apparent Chinese idioms or reinterpretations of Buddhist concepts using indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks (gexue). The presence of '聞如是' (Thus have I heard), direct addresses to individuals ('諸大長者', '阿難'), and a question-and-answer format suggest signs of oral transmission. Sentence subjects for main actors are often explicitly stated, particularly when introducing speakers or central figures; however, in more general descriptive passages or lists (like the 42 contemplations of the body), subjects can be implicitly understood, which is common in literary Chinese. The adverb '諸' (zhu) is consistently used to indicate plural forms. Tense is largely unspecified on verbs, relying on context or temporal adverbs.",

The translation tends to be literal, often resulting in verbose descriptions and the explicit stating of sentence subjects. Tense is explicitly indicated, primarily for future events. The text frequently uses '諸' (zhu) to denote plural forms. There are signs of oral transmission through narrative repetition, but no significant use of Chinese idioms, abbreviations, or interlinear commentary.

Subjects are often explicitly stated, which is less common in classical Chinese but may reflect the Indic source structure. The use of '定意' for concentration suggests a factual approach over the spiritual '三昧.' The repetitive structure in dialogues and the formulaic presentation of lists are strong indicators of oral transmission from the source text.

It is verbose, often repeating and expanding on ideas. No indigenous Chinese idioms are explicitly used in a literary sense. The tone is deeply spiritual, employing numerous specific Buddhist technical terms. The prominent emphasis on '本覺' (original enlightenment) and the detailed exploration of mind-nature and emptiness align with and likely influenced indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts, particularly in later Chinese Buddhist developments.

The translation style leans towards literal, evidenced by repetitive phrasing (e.g., '不得...不得...', '女人憙...是為X態') and a verbose approach in its extensive enumeration of rules, attitudes, and ethical points. This verbosity likely aims for thoroughness in conveying doctrine. Traditional Chinese idioms are not frequently employed. The tone is distinctly spiritual, using Buddhist technical terms. While some phrasing might subtly resonate with Chinese philosophical thought, there isn't a systematic reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese lenses. There is no interlinear commentary or apparent abbreviations. The frequent use of direct address ('阿難！') and a question-and-answer format strongly indicates a style influenced by oral transmission.

The language is generally plain and functional rather than ornate. While some established Chinese idiomatic phrases appear, the text is more verbose in its narrative and explanations, often repeating concepts for emphasis, a common feature of orally transmitted texts. The inclusion of '聞如是' (Thus have I heard) at the beginning is a clear indicator of its oral transmission origins. The content is distinctly spiritual, focusing on Buddhist doctrines and practices, using specific Buddhist terminology without strong evidence of interpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts.

The language is generally plain and straightforward, focusing on narrative clarity rather than ornate embellishment, and is terse in its expression. The content emphasizes karmic cause and effect and moral conduct (布施, 持戒) leading to tangible rewards (e.g., kingship, heavenly birth), giving it a factual tone regarding ethical consequences. While the narrative resonates with Chinese values like benevolent governance, there's no clear evidence of reinterpretation of core Buddhist doctrines through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts.

The narrative's detailed description of the mothers' sorrow makes it lean towards verbose rather than terse. The content is distinctly spiritual, revolving around Buddhist concepts like Arhatship, karma, past lives, and suffering. There is a clear sign of indigenous Chinese interpretation with the phrase '得道昇仙' (attained the path and ascended as an immortal), blending Buddhist 'attaining the path' with Daoist 'ascending as an immortal'. Additionally, the strong emphasis on filial piety (mothers' suffering) resonates deeply with Chinese cultural values. Subjects are frequently implied, which is common in Classical Chinese.

The language is plain and terse, avoiding ornate expressions or common Chinese idioms. The overall tone is spiritual, utilizing the eight virtues of the ocean as a metaphor to expound Buddhist Dharma, rather than presenting purely factual information.

While the theme of filial piety aligns with Chinese culture, the doctrinal explanations and scholastic discussions (e.g., regarding the three jewels, precepts, and Abhidharma concepts) remain distinctly Buddhist in their framework, without explicit reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The text contains formulaic expressions, repetitive phrases, and stock epithets, indicating signs of oral transmission. Abbreviations are not used in a stylistic sense. Sentence subjects are often explicit for clarity in narrative and dialogue. The plural marker 諸 (zhu) is used frequently.

The language is literary and largely plain, focusing on conveying the spiritual teachings directly rather than using ornate flourishes or indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts for interpretation. The frequent use of '何以明之?' (How to explain this?) followed by lengthy examples and the constant definition of terms indicates a pedagogical and thorough, but verbose, approach. There are clear signs of interpolations and interlinear commentary, often in parenthetical notes, which suggest later additions or clarifications.

The translation leans towards a literal rendering, maintaining repetitive structures and enumerative styles often found in Indic source texts, which can make it feel less fluent in Chinese. While employing rich imagery and extensive compound terms (e.g., '光明幢菩薩', '虛空掌珠報髻菩薩'), the language is ornate rather than plain. The tone is entirely spiritual, focusing on Buddhist doctrines, samadhi, and bodhisattva practices, explicitly using terms like '三昧' (samādhi). There is no explicit interpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks (格義), sticking to Buddhist terminology. The verbose nature, expansive lists, and somewhat repetitive explanations of similar concepts suggest possible interpolations or elaborations, which were common in early Chinese translations to clarify or emphasize points, though definitive proof would require textual comparison with the Indic original.

The use of transliterated terms with subsequent Chinese explanations suggests a technical and systematic approach to teaching complex doctrines, often employing repetitions for emphasis. The translation style is highly literal, evidenced by numerous transliterations of Indic terms like '留伽度' immediately followed by '(秦言發心住)' explanations. This indicates an early translation effort prioritizing faithfulness to the original sounds and meanings, even if it sometimes results in less fluent Chinese. The language is literary and generally plain, avoiding excessive ornamentation beyond standard Buddhist epithets. The text is verbose due to extensive enumerations and repetitions, particularly in the verse sections and the explanation of precepts, which strongly suggests an influence of oral transmission techniques (e.g., '諦聽諦聽', call-and-response during precept taking).

The presence of explicit editorial notes about the '八國分舍利品' section indicates that interpolations were present in the text as evaluated. Interlinear commentary provides pronunciation guides and brief explanations for transliterated terms and foreign place names. Strong signs of oral transmission are evident in the '如是我聞' opening, repetitive formulas, and long lists of beings.

Its original form likely involved oral transmission. The translation style by Kang Senghui, an early translator, exhibits a blend of characteristics. It is predominantly prose narratives with clearly marked verse sections, primarily using 5-syllable lines in the gathas. The language leans towards a simplified, direct narrative style, often considered ""early vernacular"" or ""translationese"" for its time, rather than highly ornate literary Chinese. The translation is quite literal, sometimes leading to stiff or direct renderings of original sentence structures. The language is plain, focusing on conveying the story and moral lessons without excessive embellishment. The narratives are verbose, laying out details explicitly rather than condensing information into minimal characters. Both indigenous Chinese idioms and specialized Buddhist idiomatic expressions (often transliterated) are present. The tone is distinctly spiritual, centered on Buddhist doctrines and karmic consequences. While Kang Senghui was known for syncretic tendencies, this text does not overtly interpret Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. Frequent ""師曰"" (the master/teacher said) comments at the end of stories indicate interpolations by the translator or compiler, offering moral conclusions. No interlinear commentary is present. The narrative structure, direct address, and moralizing conclusions strongly suggest an influence from oral transmission traditions. Abbreviated Chinese transliterations for Buddhist terms (e.g., 羅漢 for 阿羅漢) are common. Sentence subjects are often explicitly stated, especially in dialogue and when new actors are introduced, making it more explicit than terse classical Chinese. The character 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plural forms. Tense is largely unspecified, relying on context and temporal adverbs rather than explicit verbal markers.",
大比丘威儀經,T 1470,prose,0,literary,literal,plain,terse,False,factual,False,True,True,True,implicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"This text, translated by An Shigao, exhibits characteristics typical of early, literal Chinese Buddhist translations from Indic languages. The style is primarily prose, instructional, and uses plain, terse language for its numerous rules and categories. The overall presentation is verbose due to extensive enumerations and repetitions, serving as mnemonic devices indicative of oral transmission practices. Buddhist terms are often introduced with direct transliterations followed by semantic explanations (e.g., '秦言', '義言'), reflecting a literal translation approach rather than fluent rephrasing. Sentence subjects are frequently implicit, aligning with classical Chinese grammar. The plural marker 諸 (zhu) is used. Tense is generally unspecified. The focus is factual and disciplinary, detailing monastic conduct. There is no evidence of reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. A specific parenthetical note in the text explicitly identifies an interpolation from a later editor, and embedded explanations also serve as a form of interlinear commentary.",
觀無量壽經,T 365,prose,0,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,implicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The evaluated text is '佛說觀無量壽佛經' (Contemplation Sūtra), translated by Jñānayaśas. The first text, '御製無量壽佛贊', is an imperially composed hymn in verse and not a translation, thus excluded from this analysis. The sūtra is written in prose, using literary Chinese typical of early Buddhist translations. The translation style is quite literal, often adhering closely to the Indic source's structure and terminology, which sometimes results in less fluid Chinese phrasing and notable repetitions, such as the frequent phrase '作是觀者，名為正觀。若他觀者，名為邪觀' (This contemplation is called the correct contemplation. Any other contemplation is called incorrect contemplation). This repetition, along with the '如是我聞' (Thus have I heard) opening, suggests characteristics of oral transmission. The language is plain and descriptive, rather than overtly ornate, focusing on conveying the detailed visualizations and spiritual concepts. The text is verbose due to extensive enumerations and descriptions of the Pure Land, the qualities of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and the different grades of rebirth. It primarily focuses on spiritual instruction and meditative practices. There is no evidence of the Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts within the translation itself, nor are there significant interpolations or interlinear commentaries. Abbreviations are not used. Sentence subjects are often implicit, a common feature of literary Chinese, though important actors are also explicitly named. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is frequently used to denote plural forms, such as 諸佛 (Buddhas) or 諸眾生 (sentient beings). Tense is unspecified, as is typical for classical Chinese.",

The translation from an Indic language to Chinese by 竺曇無蘭 during the Eastern Jin dynasty exhibits several characteristic features of early Chinese Buddhist translations.The text is primarily prose, without fixed verse lines. Therefore, 'syllables_per_line' is set to 0 to reflect the absence of verse. The language is predominantly literary Chinese, employing classical vocabulary and grammatical structures, rather than vernacular. The translation style tends to be more literal, which is evident in the direct rendering of Buddhist technical terms and the long list of epithets for the Buddha ('至真、等正覺、明行成為、善逝、世間解、無上士、道法御、天人師'), sometimes resulting in a less fluent Chinese prose by later standards. The language, while formal, is generally plain and functional for conveying the narrative and doctrine, rather than overly ornate. The narrative is quite verbose, providing detailed accounts of events, internal monologues of characters, and explicit enumerations of Buddhist concepts and titles. There is no significant use of Chinese idioms. The tone is deeply spiritual, focusing on Buddhist teachings, karma, and enlightenment, rather than factual descriptions. Buddhist teachings are translated directly without apparent reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The text does not appear to contain interpolations or interlinear commentary. There are signs of oral transmission, such as repetitive phrases like '善哉！善哉！' and '初語亦善、中語亦善、竟語亦善', which suggest a retention of formulaic structures from the oral tradition of the source text. No abbreviations are used. While many sentences have explicit subjects, the translation also frequently omits subjects when context allows, which is characteristic of Classical Chinese, thus leaning towards 'implicit'. The plural marker 諸 (zhū) is used, for example in '諸採華人'. Tense is primarily indicated by temporal adverbs (e.g., '昔者', '時', '今', '後當') and contextual understanding, rather than explicit verbal inflections.",

The language is literary and formal but generally plain rather than ornate, focusing on conveying the Buddhist concepts directly, albeit sometimes awkwardly. The text includes both extensive prose and a short verse section (gāthā) with 5 syllables per line, followed by a transliterated dhāraṇī, indicating a mixed form. The use of '諸' (zhū) is prevalent to denote plurals. There are signs of oral transmission in the sermon-like structure and direct addresses. Sentence subjects are frequently implicit, aligning with classical Chinese conventions. Tense is generally unspecified, relying on context. There is no evidence of indigenous Chinese philosophical reinterpretation or interlinear commentary. The sudden inclusion of the verse and the dhāraṇī suggests possible interpolations or standard structural elements of sutras that might be perceived as such.",

The dialogue format (Ananda's questions, Buddha's answers) is also typical.Translation style: The translation is primarily in literary Chinese (文言文), utilizing classical vocabulary and grammatical structures (e.g., 昔者, 夫, 而白). It is generally plain and terse in its language, focusing on clear transmission of narrative and doctrine rather than ornate literary flourishes. The translation style tends to be literal, especially in rendering Buddhist technical terms and epithets (e.g., 無所著, 正真覺, 道法御, 天人師), which can sometimes result in Chinese that feels slightly less fluid but aims for conceptual accuracy. A significant feature is the interpretation of Buddhist concepts, such as śūnyatā (emptiness), through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts, specifically '本無' (benwu), associated with Xuanxue (Neo-Taoism). This indicates an interpretive translation strategy and constitutes a form of interpolation where Buddhist ideas are filtered through and explained using native Chinese frameworks. The text includes a classical Chinese idiom ('猶影尋形、響之應聲'), demonstrating the translator's command of native rhetorical devices. While predominantly prose, some repetition of epithets and direct speech elements suggest a possible influence from oral transmission traditions. Syllables per line is not applicable as the text is in prose.",

Repetitions in the text aid comprehension and may be indicative of a text designed for or derived from oral transmission. While many of the described rewards are material, the overall purpose of making Buddha images for accumulating merit leading to Nirvana is spiritual.",

The language is generally plain, focusing on clarity of doctrine rather than ornate literary embellishment. However, the text is verbose, characterized by extensive descriptions, lists of epithets, and repetitions common in sutra literature derived from Indic traditions. No prominent traditional Chinese idioms are used. The tone is spiritual, discussing Buddhist concepts like Bodhi, Nirvana, and Samadhi, and emphasizing the path to enlightenment. There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted using indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts in an overt way. No obvious interpolations or interlinear commentaries are present. The opening phrase '如是我聞' (Thus have I heard) and the repetitive narrative structure indicate signs of oral transmission. Abbreviations are not used. Sentence subjects are frequently implicit, relying on context for understanding, a common feature of Classical Chinese. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plural forms (e.g., 諸佛, 諸菩薩).

This repetition, along with the direct addresses ('諦聽，諦聽！'), is indicative of an oral transmission style. The language is literary and formal, rather than vernacular, but generally plain and direct in its vocabulary, avoiding overly ornate literary devices. Its verbosity stems from the extensive reiteration of these formulas. The translation appears quite literal, adhering closely to the structure and phraseology of the presumed Indic source. Subjects are often explicitly stated, contributing to this literal style. The content is predominantly spiritual, focusing on the merits of hearing and reciting Buddha names for liberation and enlightenment.

The language is plain, focusing on conveying the names and merits rather than ornate descriptions. There are no obvious Chinese idioms. The tone is spiritual, focusing on the salvific power of Buddha names. There is no clear evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts.

However, the syllable count for these invocations varies significantly (e.g., 5-8 syllables per invocation, with 6 being a common length for 3-character names). Therefore, 'syllables_per_line' is given as 6 as a representative average for the verse-like parts, but without strict regularity. The language is classical Chinese. The translation demonstrates fluency, rather than being strictly literal, especially in the prose sections. It uses plain language without ornate embellishment and is verbose, particularly in the detailed confession sections.

The language is plain, focusing on direct conveyance of doctrine and narrative rather than ornate embellishment. It is verbose due to frequent repetitions, extensive enumerations of names (e.g., Buddhas, Bodhisattvas), and detailed descriptions. Common Chinese idioms are used within the classical framework. The tone is deeply spiritual, employing numerous Buddhist technical terms such as samādhi, dhāraṇī, and pāramitās. There is no clear evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. While external editorial notes are present, there is no interlinear commentary embedded within the translated text itself. Without the original Indic text, definitive identification of interpolations is difficult, but there are no obvious signs of substantial content additions not found in typical Mahayana sutras. The presence of formulaic expressions (e.g., '如是我聞', '爾時世尊', '諦聽諦聽善思念之'), call-and-response dialogues, and repetitions strongly indicates a style conducive to oral transmission. No specific abbreviations of terms or titles are used; full epithets and names are generally provided.

It tends to be more literal in its rendering from the Indic source, resulting in a somewhat verbose style with frequent repetition of phrases and subjects (e.g., '太子曰', '馭者對曰'). This literalness and repetition can make the Chinese less fluent or naturalistic than later, more refined translations, contributing to what is sometimes termed 'translationese'. The language used is plain, without ornate embellishment, focusing on clear narrative conveyance. There are no readily identifiable traditional Chinese idioms.

Abbreviations like '佛' (for Buddha) and '羅漢' (for Arhat) are common, and the pluralizer '諸' is frequently used. Sentence subjects are often implicit, following classical Chinese grammar, though explicit when introducing new actors or for clarity.

However, it employs classical Chinese grammar and vocabulary, aligning it with 'literary' rather than 'vernacular' forms. The language is generally plain and direct, focusing on conveying karmic consequences without ornate embellishments. While individual statements are often concise, the overall presentation is verbose due to the exhaustive enumeration of 'ten evil deeds' for each category and the repetition of structural phrases like '是為十惡事' and '何等十?', as well as the detailed list of 'thirty-five evils' from drinking. The 'factual' tone arises from presenting karmic cause-and-effect as a direct set of observable facts and consequences, rather than exploring abstract spiritual experiences. There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being interpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The phrase '如是我聞' (Thus have I heard) and the highly structured, enumerative nature of the lists suggest a style that would aid memorization and oral transmission.

The text is somewhat verbose, characterized by repetitions, detailed enumerations of Buddhist concepts (e.g., components of the path), and extended dialogues, which are common features in texts translated from Indic languages. The text does not extensively use common Chinese idiomatic expressions or chengyu; fixed phrases tend to be descriptive or ritualistic. The tone is distinctly spiritual, focusing on concepts like nirvana ('泥曰', '滅度'), arhatship ('應真'), miraculous powers, and the spiritual path. There are indications of interpretation through indigenous Chinese concepts, particularly the phrase '還靈乎本無' (returning the spirit to fundamental nothingness), which resonates with Daoist philosophical ideas, and the emphasis on '重恩' for maternal love, which aligns with Confucian filial piety. The repeated section titled '佛般泥洹後變記' (Record of transformations after Buddha's nirvana) appears twice at the end and describes the decline of the dharma over a thousand years, which feels like an appended prophetic or historical commentary rather than an integral part of the main sutra narrative, suggesting it might be an interpolation.

The numerous short, direct commands and statements, often with implied subjects, contribute to a terse feel within individual points, but the exhaustive listing of categories makes the overall text verbose. The direct address and repetitive structure also point to characteristics suitable for oral transmission and memorization in a monastic setting. While the text uses Chinese characters and constructs, it does not appear to interpret Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. Tense is largely unspecified, as is common in Classical Chinese and instructional texts.",
沙彌尼戒,T 1474,prose,0,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,True,True,False,True,implicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The text displays characteristics of early Chinese Buddhist translations from the Later Han period. It is written in a simplified literary Chinese, often referred to as 'translationese,' which is less complex than high Classical Chinese but not truly vernacular. The translation tends to be literal, sometimes resulting in slightly wordy or less natural phrasing when compared to native Chinese prose. It is verbose, providing detailed explanations and numerous analogies for each precept. While the precepts themselves are practical rules, the underlying motivations and goals are distinctly spiritual, utilizing terms like '三昧' (samādhi), '大乘' (Mahayana), and '神通' (supernatural powers). There is a clear integration of indigenous Chinese thought, particularly the emphasis on filial piety (父母, 孝) and family relationships as analogies for spiritual conduct. Given the early date and didactic style, interpolations in the form of expanded explanations and culturally resonant analogies are highly probable. The repetitive structure of introducing each precept ('沙彌尼戒') and the use of lists and analogies suggest a style conducive to oral transmission and memorization. Sentence subjects are frequently implicit, typical of Classical Chinese grammar, and tense is generally unspecified, relying on context.",
受十善戒經,T 1486,mixed,5,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,explicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The text is predominantly prose, narrating teachings and dialogues, but it contains several distinct sections of verse (頌曰) used for praise or summarizing teachings. The verse sections consistently feature five syllables per line, a common meter in early Chinese Buddhist verse. The language is formal and uses classical Buddhist terminology, characteristic of early Chinese Buddhist translations, making it literary rather than colloquial. The translation exhibits a certain directness and repetition, possibly adhering closely to the Indic source text structure, which is characteristic of early, more literal translations. While descriptions of hells are vivid and graphic, the linguistic style itself is straightforward and functional, lacking extensive literary embellishment or complex metaphors beyond the explicit imagery. The text is verbose, especially in its repetitive descriptions of the ten evil karmas and their retributions, with the same condemnatory phrases from Yama repeated frequently. No significant use of indigenous Chinese idioms is observed; the language is direct and primarily focused on conveying Buddhist concepts. The text's focus is on the spiritual consequences of actions, emphasizing karmic retribution, liberation, and the path to Buddhahood, clearly aligning with a spiritual tone. The text primarily uses established Buddhist terminology (e.g., ""涅槃"", ""菩提"", ""阿羅漢"") without apparent reinterpretation of core Buddhist doctrines through purely Chinese philosophical concepts. There are no obvious internal inconsistencies or stylistic shifts within the provided excerpt that would strongly indicate interpolations. The provided text does not contain any interlinear commentary. The repetitive phrases, rhetorical questions, and call-and-response patterns (e.g., ""如是三說"", ""汝能持不？若言能持"") strongly suggest the text was intended for oral recitation and instruction. No obvious abbreviations of terms are used. Subjects are frequently stated explicitly, particularly in dialogues and narrative transitions, ensuring clarity of who is speaking or performing an action. The character ""諸"" (zhū) is extensively used throughout the text to denote plural forms, such as ""諸佛"" (all Buddhas) and ""諸天"" (all devas). Tense is generally left unspecified, as is common in classical Chinese, with the temporal context inferred from the sequence of events.",
優婆塞五戒經,T 1503,mixed,4,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,True,False,True,implicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The text begins and ends with clear verse sections, but the main body is extensive prose, detailing rules and offenses. The verse sections primarily use four characters per line. The language is formal and uses classical structures, typical of early Buddhist translations into 'literary' Chinese. The translation style tends to be 'literal', evident in the repetitive and formulaic phrasing, particularly when enumerating rules and their exceptions (e.g., ""是名菩薩波羅夷"", ""若...者，犯重垢罪。不犯者，若...""), which gives it a somewhat legalistic and precise tone. The language is 'plain' and direct, focusing on instruction rather than ornate expression. It is 'verbose' due to the comprehensive enumeration of rules, conditions, and exceptions. No distinct Chinese idioms are used. While presenting rules, the overarching goal and terminology (e.g., samādhi, Bodhi, afflictions) are 'spiritual' in nature, guiding practitioners towards liberation. There is no clear evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts; the terminology remains distinctly Buddhist. The presence of highly specific ritual instructions like '受繩床法' (receiving the rope bed dharma) and '受錫杖法' (receiving the staff dharma), along with detailed repentance procedures, suggests 'interpolations' or extensive adaptation for Chinese practice beyond a core Indic source. There is no 'interlinear commentary'. The opening address ""諸大德！一心諦聽諦聽，善思念之"" and the repetitive nature of the rules strongly indicate signs of 'oral transmission'. No abbreviations are used. Sentence subjects are frequently 'implicit', relying on context, which is common in classical Chinese. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is extensively used to indicate plural forms (e.g., ""諸佛"", ""諸菩薩""). Tense is largely 'unspecified', relying on contextual understanding rather than explicit grammatical markers.",

The translation style is quite literal, often preserving foreign terms through transliteration (e.g., Prajñāpāramitā, Upāyakauśalya, Tathāgata, and names of various stages of awakening). The language is generally plain and terse, favoring direct communication over embellishment, though it uses some classical expressions indicative of a literary style. Idiomatic expressions like ""狐疑"" (fox's doubt for deep suspicion) and ""如毛髮者"" (like a hair, for even the slightest) are present. The tone is spiritual, focusing on the path of discipleship and Buddhist concepts. There are no apparent signs of indigenous Chinese philosophical reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts. The text shows signs of oral transmission through its ""Thus have I heard"" opening formula and dialogue format. Sentence subjects are often implicit, which is typical of Classical Chinese. The adverb ""諸"" is used to indicate plurality (e.g., ""諸弟子""). Verbal tense is largely unspecified and inferred from context, rather than explicitly marked.",
弟子死復生經,T 862,prose,0,literary,literal,plain,terse,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,explicit,True,unspecified,True,False,False,"Source Text Style (Indic, probably Sanskrit): The underlying source text appears to be a didactic narrative, common in Mahayana sutras, using a story (the disciple's death and return, his journey through hell) to illustrate Buddhist teachings on karma, rebirth, ethics, and the path to liberation. The inclusion of detailed lists of Buddhist doctrines (like the Six Pāramitās, Five Skandhas, Three Poisons, Six Sense Faculties) suggests a canonical text meant for instruction. The narrative's emphasis on the consequences of actions (good and bad) and the protection afforded to practitioners of the Dharma points to a spiritual and ethical focus. The dialogue between the hell king and his officers, and between the Buddha and Ananda, is a common trope for conveying complex teachings in an accessible manner, which might suggest an oral tradition influence in the source. Translation Style (into Chinese by Juqu Jingsheng): *   Verse or Prose: The translation is clearly in prose, presenting a continuous narrative interspersed with dialogues and didactic passages. *   Syllables per Line: As a prose text, this metric is not applicable. *   Vernacular or Literary: The translation employs a form of literary Chinese (文言), characterized by classical sentence structures, vocabulary (e.g., 爾時, 遂奄忽如死, 莫殯斂), and a more formal tone. It is not written in vernacular (白話) Chinese. *   Literal or Fluent: The translation leans towards a literal style, particularly evident in the extensive use of phonetic transliterations for Sanskrit terms (e.g., 閻浮利 for Jambudvīpa, 阿羅漢 for Arhat, 阿惟越致 for Avaivartika, the various Pāramitās like 檀波羅蜜 for Dāna-pāramitā, 般若波羅蜜 for Prajñā-pāramitā, 漚惒拘舍羅 for Upāya-kauśalya, 摩訶薩 for Mahāsattva, 般泥洹 for Parinirvāṇa). While generally understandable, some phrasing might appear less natural to a purely classical Chinese reader, suggesting a direct rendering from the source. *   Ornate or Plain Language: The language is predominantly plain and functional. Its primary aim is to convey the narrative and doctrinal content clearly and directly, without significant use of ornate expressions, elaborate metaphors, or stylistic embellishments typical of highly literary Chinese prose. *   Terse or Verbose: The translation is generally terse. The narrative progresses efficiently, and even the doctrinal explanations, while sometimes presented as lists, are concise and to the point rather than overly verbose. *   Idioms Used: There is no prominent use of indigenous Chinese idioms (成語) in the translation. The language focuses on direct communication of Buddhist concepts. *   Factual or Spiritual Tone: The tone is distinctly spiritual. The text deals with profound Buddhist concepts such as karma, rebirth in different realms (hells, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, gods), the efficacy of the Dharma, the importance of precepts and good deeds (like the Six Pāramitās), and the path to enlightenment. Terms like ""定"" (concentration) vs. ""三昧"" (samādhi) are addressed through the use of 禪波羅蜜 (Dhyāna-pāramitā), which implies the spiritual practice of samādhi. *   Indigenous Chinese Interpretation: While the text discusses moral behavior (filial piety, loyalty to ruler) that resonates with Confucian ethics, these are presented within the broader Buddhist framework of karmic causality and rebirth, rather than being reinterpreted through an indigenous Chinese philosophical lens that alters their core Buddhist meaning. The fundamental Buddhist doctrines remain distinct. *   Interpolations: There are no clear indications of significant interpolations by the translator that would extend beyond the scope of a typical Indic Buddhist text. The narrative flows consistently with common Mahayana themes. *   Interlinear Commentary: No interlinear commentary is present in the provided text. *   Oral Transmission: Yes, there are signs of oral transmission influence. The narrative structure, featuring dialogues (especially the question-and-answer format between the king and his officer, and between the Buddha and Ananda), and the repetitive listing and explanation of doctrinal points (e.g., the Six Pāramitās, the Five Skandhas, Three Poisons), are common characteristics of texts intended for oral presentation and memorization. *   Abbreviations Used: Yes, standard abbreviations or shortened transliterations for Buddhist terms are used, such as 佛 (Buddha), 阿難 (Ānanda), 比丘 (Bhikṣu), 菩薩 (Bodhisattva), 沙門 (Śramaṇa). *   Explicit Sentence Subject: The translation often employs explicit sentence subjects, particularly in narrative clauses and direct speech (e.g., ""王言"" (The King said), ""吏白王言"" (The officer reported to the King), ""我便叩頭"" (I then bowed my head), ""佛語阿難"" (The Buddha said to Ananda)). While classical Chinese permits subject omission, this text frequently includes them for clarity. *   Plural Zhū: Yes, the character 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plural forms, such as ""諸家"" (all families), ""諸惡人"" (all evil people), ""諸比丘"" (all bhikṣus), and ""諸菩薩"" (all bodhisattvas). *   Tense Indication: Tense is largely unspecified. The narrative unfolds sequentially, with actions described without explicit grammatical markers for past, present, or future tense. Temporal adverbs like ""一時"" (at one time), ""爾時"" (at that time), and ""今"" (now) provide context, but the verbs themselves do not carry explicit tense.",
頂生王故事經,T 39,mixed,5,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,explicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The source text, likely Sanskrit, exhibits a style characterized by extensive repetition, verbose descriptions, formulaic phrasing (e.g., lists of wealth and virtues for each kingdom), direct address (to Ananda), and a mixture of prose and verse. The spiritual theme of transcending desire and the path to liberation is central. The translation style, typical of early Chinese Buddhist translations from the Western Jin dynasty, is largely literal. This literal approach means that many stylistic features of the Indic source, such as its verbosity and repetition, are directly carried over into the Chinese. The language is plain and direct, focusing on conveying the narrative and teachings rather than employing ornate Chinese literary devices or indigenous idioms. Sentence subjects are frequently explicit, contributing to clarity in a literal translation. The text uses '諸' (zhu) for plurals, and tense is generally left unspecified, inferred from context and temporal adverbs, as is common in Classical Chinese.",

The language is literary, characteristic of early Buddhist translations, employing classical structures and particles. The translation style is quite literal, often reflecting the Indic source's syntax and vocabulary, leading to terms like '婆伽婆' (Bhagavān) and direct, one-to-one translation of epithets. This literalness, combined with frequent repetition of stock phrases and lists of qualities (e.g., the Buddha's epithets, descriptions of offerings), makes the language verbose, though it remains plain and functional rather than ornate. No distinct Chinese idioms are employed. The tone is spiritual, focusing on Buddhist teachings, epithets, and practices. There is no evident reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophical lenses. The text contains interpolations in the form of parenthetical glosses, such as '(顏色)' and '(端正)' for '頻毘娑羅', which clarify the meaning of transliterated terms. While these are explanatory, they are embedded within the text rather than appearing as separate interlinear commentary. The highly formulaic and repetitive nature of descriptions and narrative segments strongly suggests a source text rooted in oral transmission. Subjects are frequently made explicit, especially when introducing new actors or reiterating focus. The plural marker '諸' (zhu) is consistently used (e.g., '諸群臣', '諸佛'). Tense is largely unspecified, relying on temporal adverbs like '爾時' (at that time) to establish the narrative sequence.",

The translation style is characteristic of early Chinese Buddhist translations from Indic languages during the Western Jin period, often being quite literal to the source, which can result in repetitive phrasing and a somewhat less fluid Chinese prose. The language is classical/literary but uses plain terms rather than ornate language. The narrative includes extensive repetition (e.g., the sequence of questions and answers about rebirth realms), indicating a strong influence of oral transmission from the source text. Subjects are frequently and explicitly stated, contributing to clarity in the translation.",
阿闍世王受決經,T 509,prose,0,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,implicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The text is a continuous prose narrative, typical of early Buddhist sutras, with a detailed storyline. The language style is literary Chinese, consistent with early translations from Indic languages, sometimes exhibiting 'translationese' characteristics due to a literal rendering of the source text's structure. It prioritizes conveying the narrative and spiritual message directly, rather than using ornate literary devices or existing Chinese idioms. The detailed storytelling and dialogue lead to a more verbose style compared to terse classical Chinese prose. The opening '聞如是' (Thus have I heard) is a clear indication of its origin in an oral transmission tradition. Plurality is occasionally indicated by '諸' (zhu).

It employs a mixed style, featuring both detailed prose narrative and significant sections of verse, predominantly with seven syllables per line, though a shorter four-syllable verse form also appears. The language is literary Chinese, using classical grammatical structures. The translation tends towards a literal rendering of the source text, which sometimes results in phrasing that might feel somewhat stiff in Chinese but preserves the original's structure. It uses ornate and descriptive language, particularly when depicting the Buddha's radiance or the repulsive nature of the human body, and is verbose in its elaborations on the dangers of desire. The tone is distinctly spiritual, focusing on Buddhist ethical teachings, karmic consequences, and liberation from attachment, without incorporating indigenous Chinese philosophical reinterpretations. There is no interlinear commentary or unusual abbreviations. Signs of oral transmission are evident through the opening '聞如是' (Thus have I heard) and the repetitive, formulaic structure of certain discourses. Sentence subjects are frequently implicit, relying on contextual understanding, and tense is generally unspecified, inferred rather than explicitly marked.

The first gāthā is 5 syllables per line, and the second, longer gāthā, although starting with irregular line lengths (10, 8, 10, 8 syllables), predominantly uses 7 syllables per line for the majority of its verses. The translation often appears literal, resulting in some less fluent Chinese phrasing. The concluding sentence before the final gāthā, referencing 'this scroll' and 'Arthavargiya-sūtra', suggests an interpolation or editorial note from the Chinese tradition. The canonical opening '聞如是' indicates oral transmission.",
察微王經,T 152 (90),prose,0,literary,fluent,plain,verbose,True,spiritual,False,False,False,False,implicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The text is a Buddhist narrative (a Jātaka-like story) about a Bodhisattva king teaching about impermanence, karma, and rebirth through a practical demonstration. As the text is written in prose, the 'syllables_per_line' field is not applicable. The language employed is sophisticated classical Chinese, not everyday vernacular. The translation reads fluently within this classical Chinese style, suggesting an effort to convey meaning smoothly rather than a strict word-for-word rendering. While the language is highly literary, it is primarily descriptive and didactic, focusing on conveying the narrative and teachings clearly rather than employing excessive stylistic embellishment; thus, it is categorized as 'plain' in the sense of 'not overly ornate'. The narrative includes detailed descriptions and explanations, leading to a 'verbose' style rather than being overly concise. The content delves into fundamental Buddhist doctrines of karma, rebirth, and the nature of consciousness, presenting them from a 'spiritual' perspective of ultimate truth. While terms like '元氣' (primordial qi) are used in describing the elements, their usage primarily serves to elucidate the constituent elements of existence within a Buddhist cosmological framework, rather than reinterpreting Buddhist doctrine through distinct indigenous Chinese philosophical systems. The text frequently omits subjects where context makes them clear, a common feature of classical Chinese; although explicit subjects are also present, the reliance on implicit subjects is notable. Tense is primarily indicated by context and temporal adverbs, as is characteristic of classical Chinese.",

Subjects are often explicitly stated, a common feature of early literal translations. While language is generally plain, some verse blocks consistently use a 4-syllable meter, typical of gathas, though one earlier verse block features 7 syllables per line. Buddhist concepts are presented spiritually. The passage at [0175c14] explaining the text's purpose appears to be an interpolation by the Chinese redactor/translator. '諸比丘' is used for plural.",

The tone is distinctly spiritual, focusing on Buddhist doctrines, miraculous events, and karmic outcomes. There is no clear evidence of Buddhist teachings being interpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. No interlinear commentary or obvious interpolations are present.

The language is plain rather than ornate. The narrative style is verbose, often employing repetition, which, along with formulaic openings and direct address, points to signs of oral transmission. While the story describes 'factual' human qualities (wisdom, craftsmanship, etc.), the overall context of karma, past lives, and the ultimate attainment of Buddhahood firmly places it in a spiritual framework. The translation does not appear to reinterpret Buddhist concepts using indigenous Chinese philosophical terms. Subjects are often implicit, typical of classical Chinese.

The language is closer to vernacular than highly literary Chinese, characterized by direct phrasing, occasional grammatical awkwardness, and the inclusion of parenthetical glosses for transliterated terms (e.g., '(晉曰志性)', '(晉言棄家)'). This reflects the early stage of Buddhist translation in China and a literal approach to the Indic source, sometimes resulting in phrasing less natural in classical Chinese (e.g., '聞如是'). The language is generally plain, prioritizing the clear conveyance of information. The text is verbose, especially in its detailed enumeration of astronomical data, measurements, and lengthy, repetitive arguments in the debate sections. No significant use of indigenous Chinese idioms is observed. While framed within a Buddhist narrative involving spiritual intervention, a substantial portion of the text, particularly the lengthy debate between the King and the Brahmin, is highly factual, discussing astronomy, caste systems, societal norms, and rituals in detail. The translation largely avoids interpreting Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts; the content is distinctly Indian in origin. The text contains parenthetical glosses providing Chinese equivalents or explanations for transliterated Indic terms, serving as embedded interlinear commentary and suggesting interpolations for clarity. The presence of formulaic openings ('聞如是'), repetitive narrative structures, and detailed enumerations suggests characteristics common in texts intended for oral transmission and recitation. No abbreviations are used. Sentence subjects are generally made explicit, rather than relying on implicit subjects common in classical Chinese, likely due to the influence of the Indic source language. The character 諸 (zhū) is extensively and consistently used to indicate plural forms (e.g., 諸佛, 諸比丘, 諸宿). Tense is typically left unspecified and inferred from context or indicated by temporal adverbs (e.g., 一時, 即, 當), rather than through explicit verb conjugations.",

The language is plain and direct, aiming for clear exposition rather than ornate expression, making it lean towards a vernacular form of classical Chinese for its time. Due to the repetitive Q&A structure and detailed explanations of karmic causality, the text tends to be verbose. No specific Chinese idioms are observed. The content is distinctly spiritual, focusing on Buddhist karmic principles and the attainment of spiritual qualities. There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being interpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The text does not contain obvious interpolations or interlinear commentary.

The language is 'plain' in the sense that it avoids excessive ornamentation or flowery metaphors, prioritizing direct conveyance of meaning. However, the overall tone in the prose sections can be quite 'verbose', with detailed descriptions and elaborate narrative elements. There are no obvious Chinese idioms used. The text's tone is 'spiritual', focusing on moral cultivation, the dharma, karma, rebirth, and the path to enlightenment through virtuous conduct. The strong emphasis on filial piety (孝順) and the role of moral governance, along with the call to cultivate ancestral principles, suggests that Buddhist teachings were interpreted in alignment with 'indigenous Chinese' philosophical concepts, particularly Confucian ethics. There is no evidence of 'interpolations' or 'interlinear commentary'. The repetitive question-and-answer format in the verse sections strongly indicates 'oral transmission' as a likely mode of teaching or preservation. No 'abbreviations' are apparent.

The language is plain and didactic, focusing on clear instruction rather than ornate expression. While the narrative portions are straightforward, the extensive detailing and repetition in describing the 'seven types of wives' make the explanatory sections verbose. There are no apparent Chinese idioms or abbreviations. The frequent use of phrases like '佛告玉耶' (The Buddha told Yu Ye) and '諦聽諦聽' (Listen carefully, listen carefully) indicates a style intended for oral transmission. Subjects are generally explicit. The adverb '諸' is used to denote plural forms (e.g., '諸弟子'). Tense is largely unspecified, as is common in classical Chinese. A significant characteristic is the strong adaptation of Buddhist teachings to indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts, particularly Confucian ethics concerning familial roles and wifely duties, which is evident in the detailed categorization and moral instructions for wives. This adaptation suggests the presence of interpolations or significant cultural framing to resonate with the Chinese audience.",

However, the narrative includes repetitions, particularly in dialogue (e.g., Zhi's persistent requests, Sakra's repeated discouragement), which could be seen as verbose in terms of narrative structure, but the phrasing itself is not overly elaborate. The text does not employ common classical Chinese idioms (成語). The entire narrative revolves around spiritual aspirations, the path to Buddhahood, merit-making, and the overcoming of spiritual obstacles, clearly indicating a spiritual tone. As an early translation by An Shigao, the text shows minimal evidence of Buddhist concepts being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks (like Daoism or Confucianism); the focus is on direct transmission. There is no overt evidence within the text to suggest significant interpolations. Given An Shigao's general translation style, it's likely a relatively faithful, though literal, rendering of the source text. Without the original Indic text, a definitive assessment is difficult. The provided text excerpt does not contain any interlinear commentary; the additional text is metadata from the digital edition. The formulaic opening ""聞如是"" (Thus have I heard) and the repetitive dialogue patterns are strong indicators of an oral transmission tradition underlying the source text. No apparent abbreviations of terms or names are used within the text. While classical Chinese often omits subjects, this translation frequently includes explicit subjects, particularly when speakers or agents change, reflecting a more explicit structure potentially inherited from the Indic source. The character 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to denote plural forms, as seen in ""諸佛"" (all Buddhas) and ""諸比丘僧"" (all Bhikṣu Saṅgha). Tense is largely unspecified grammatically in Chinese verbs. Temporal adverbs and context are used to indicate timeframes (e.g., ""一時"" for past, ""當"" for future), but verb forms do not change.",

The language is generally plain and terse, focusing on conveying the narrative and Buddhist principles directly. Idioms are used sparingly but effectively. The subject matter is spiritual, dealing with karma, impermanence, and rebirth, without overt reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophies.

This literalness leads to a verbose style rather than a terse one. The language itself is plain, focusing on clarity of doctrine rather than embellishment. No obvious Chinese idioms are used. The tone is spiritual, employing specific Buddhist terms for meditative states and liberation (e.g., '意解脫', '四禪', '漏盡', '阿那含'). There is no clear reinterpretation of Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The provided text does not contain interpolations or interlinear commentary. The extensive repetition of phrases, especially in dialogues and descriptive passages, strongly suggests that the original Indic source text had an oral transmission style, which the translation preserves. Abbreviations are not used. Sentence subjects are frequently stated explicitly, even when context might allow for omission, which is typical of a literal translation approach from a language that relies more heavily on explicit subjects. The adverb 諸 (zhu) is used to indicate plural forms (e.g., '諸上尊比丘', '諸方'). Tense is largely left unspecified, relying on contextual cues and the sequence of events rather than explicit verbal markings.",

Repetitive phrasing (e.g., questions and answers fully reiterated) and explicit subjects are common, likely reflecting both the source language and an oral tradition.

As an early translation by An Shigao, the language is direct and functional, lacking the refined stylistic elements of later literary Chinese; it represents an early, somewhat unpolished style closer to a functional vernacular of its time, rather than highly cultivated literary Chinese. An Shigao's translations are known for their literal approach, often translating word-for-word, which can result in less fluent Chinese phrasing compared to later, more interpretive translations; repetitive structures like '是為' are indicative of this literal style. The language is direct and generally concise within individual statements or enumerated points, even if the overall discourse has repetition (e.g., '佛言'); it avoids elaborate descriptions or flowery language. The frequent use of explicit subjects, such as '佛言' (Buddha said), '比丘' (monk), '菩薩' (Bodhisattva), makes the subject clear in many sentences, contrasting with the more implicit subject usage often found in classical Chinese. The text's didactic nature, use of direct speech ('佛言'), frequent enumeration of points ('三因緣', '四事'), and parables ('譬如') are strong indicators of its origin in oral teaching and transmission.",

Translation style (Chinese, Western Jin by Fǎjù): This is an very early translation, exhibiting characteristics of the 'literal' (直譯) school. The text is continuous prose, typical for sutras, hence 0 syllables per line. The language is 'literary' due to its formal register, use of classical terms, and lack of colloquialisms, even though it avoids highly complex classical syntax. It is a 'literal' translation, evidenced by numerous direct transliterations (e.g., 婆伽婆, 舍利弗, 羅閱祇), repetitive sentence structures that mirror Indic syntax (e.g., repeated subjects and clauses), and a direct word-for-word approach. Consequently, the language is 'verbose' due to these repetitions, rather than concise, and employs 'plain' language without ornate flourishes, focusing on clear exposition. No traditional Chinese 'idioms' are used. The tone is 'factual', using descriptive terms for Buddhist concepts like '求欲' (desire/craving) and '定' (concentration) and focusing on ethical conduct and its consequences, rather than mystical or abstract spiritual experiences. There is no evidence of 'indigenous Chinese' philosophical concepts being used for interpretation. There are no apparent 'interpolations' or 'interlinear commentary'. Signs of 'oral transmission' are strong, including the opening '聞如是' (Thus have I heard), direct addresses like '諸賢' (gentlemen), and the question-and-answer format with subsequent similes. 'Abbreviations' are not used. 'Explicit sentence subjects' are frequently stated and often repeated, a characteristic of literal translation from Indic languages. The plural marker '諸' (zhū) is extensively used for terms like '諸比丘' (bhikṣus) and '諸惡法' (evil dharmas). 'Tense' is generally 'unspecified', relying on context; while the particle '已' (yǐ) indicates completed action, there isn't a comprehensive system to mark past, present, or future tenses explicitly throughout the text.",

The text features dialogue and repetitive structures, along with rhetorical questions, suggesting an origin in or influence from oral transmission. While the subject matter is spiritual, the presentation of karmic consequences and Buddhist practices is factual and straightforward, emphasizing cause-and-effect.

The language is plain and direct, without ornate embellishments or the use of indigenous Chinese idioms. The content addresses fundamental Buddhist philosophical and doctrinal questions (wrong views, unanswerable questions), indicating a spiritual rather than purely factual tone.

The translation style exhibits several key features:1. Verse/Prose: The text is primarily prose, characterized by continuous narrative and discourse without clear metrical or rhyming patterns.2. Syllables per line: Not applicable as it is prose, hence 0.3. Vernacular/Literary: The translation uses a literary style, formal and somewhat archaic, reflecting early Buddhist ""translationese"" rather than everyday vernacular speech, though its grammar is heavily influenced by the source language.4. Literal/Fluent: The translation is notably literal, preserving the repetitive structure and often the syntax of the Indic original, which can make it verbose and somewhat less natural in Chinese. Phrases are often directly mapped.5. Ornate/Plain: The language is generally plain and direct, focusing on clear transmission of doctrine rather than aesthetic embellishment.6. Terse/Verbose: The text is verbose due to frequent repetitions of phrases and detailed enumerations characteristic of sutra style, faithfully rendered from the source.7. Idioms: No distinctly Chinese idioms were found.8. Factual/Spiritual: While the subject is spiritual (Buddhist teachings on suffering and liberation), the presentation of the ""decay"" and ""abandonment"" of lust, form, and feeling is very concrete and descriptive of worldly phenomena and their consequences, leaning towards a factual analysis within the spiritual framework.9. Indigenous Chinese concepts: The translation adheres to standard Buddhist terminology and does not appear to reinterpret Buddhist teachings through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts.10. Interpolations: No interpolations (later editorial additions to the main text) are apparent.11. Interlinear commentary: No interlinear commentary is present in the provided text.12. Oral transmission: The opening formula ""聞如是"" (Thus have I heard) and the highly repetitive nature of the discourse (e.g., repeated questions and answers, repeated explanatory clauses) strongly indicate signs of oral transmission and memorization.13. Abbreviations: No specific abbreviations or technical shorthand beyond natural ellipsis in prose were observed.14. Explicit/Implicit sentence subject: The translation tends towards explicit sentence subjects, frequently stating them even when they might be implied in native Chinese, reflecting a literal rendering of the source language's grammatical preference.15. Plural '諸': Yes, the character 諸 (zhu) is frequently used to indicate plural forms (e.g., 諸比丘, 諸異道異學).16.

Dharmarakṣa's translations are often noted for this quality. 4. Literal/Fluent: The translation leans towards literalness. Terms like '般泥洹' (parinirvana) and '灌臘' (ablution, offering) are transliterations or direct semantic renderings. The phrasing '聞如是' (Thus have I heard) is a direct translation of the Indic opening formula. The sentence structure sometimes feels quite direct, possibly reflecting the source syntax. 5. Ornate/Plain: The language is generally plain and functional, focusing on conveying the message directly rather than employing extensive literary embellishments or rhetorical devices. 6. Terse/Verbose: The text is rather verbose, particularly in its detailed enumeration of the five sins and three evil paths, providing extensive explanations of karmic consequences and the intricacies of the ritual. 7. Idioms used: No discernible Chinese idioms are used in this excerpt. 8. Factual/Spiritual: While the topic concerns spiritual rituals and karmic retribution, the presentation of the consequences, such as the '五罪' (five sins) and '三惡道' (three evil paths) and the description of material loss, is very direct and almost 'factual' in its detailing of cause and effect. The overarching aim, however, is spiritual benefit and liberation. 9. Indigenous Chinese interpretation: There is no overt evidence in this excerpt of Buddhist teachings being interpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The terminology and explanations seem to adhere closely to the Indic Buddhist framework. 10. Interpolations: No clear interpolations are evident in this brief excerpt. Early translations often had a degree of interpretative freedom, but nothing stands out as a distinct addition from the perspective of this passage alone. 11. Interlinear commentary: No interlinear commentary is present in the text. 12. Oral transmission: The text exhibits some characteristics that could suggest oral transmission, such as direct address ('佛語阿難'), detailed enumerations ('何等為五? 一者...是為五. 更罪三惡: 一者...'), and a relatively direct, somewhat less polished flow than later highly literary translations. Dharmarakṣa was known to work with oral dictation. 13. Abbreviations used: No specific abbreviations are apparent in this text. 14.

While classical Chinese inherently allows for implicit subjects, this translation tends towards explicit subjects where relevant, and frequently uses 諸 (zhu) for pluralization (e.g., 諸比丘, 諸賢).

The translation tends to be literal, often retaining direct transliterations of Indic names (e.g., 目乾連 for Maudgalyāyana, 舍衛國 for Srāvasti) and exhibiting a more direct, less stylized syntax compared to fluent Chinese prose. The language is plain and terse, focusing on conveying the narrative and teachings without ornate embellishment or excessive verbosity. No distinct Chinese idioms are used. The tone is profoundly spiritual, utilizing specific Buddhist terms for concepts like meditation ('禪定') and karmic states ('餓鬼', '三途'). A significant feature of this translation, and the Ullambana Sutra's reception in China, is its strong emphasis on filial piety (孝順) and repaying the kindness of parents (報乳哺之恩). This deep alignment with indigenous Chinese Confucian values suggests that the Buddhist teachings were interpreted or adapted to resonate strongly with the local cultural context, hence 'indigenous_chinese' is true. Due to this pronounced emphasis on filial piety, which is often discussed as a development or elaboration within the Chinese Buddhist tradition, 'interpolations' is also marked as true in the context of the translated text's historical development.

The language is plain and vernacular, avoiding ornate structures or complex literary devices. While individual clauses are simple, the exhaustive listing of categories makes the text verbose. Subjects like '佛' and '比丘' are explicitly stated, and '諸' is used to indicate plural forms. Tense is left unspecified. The tone focuses on observable classifications of human traits and their associations, lending a factual rather than deeply spiritual presentation to the content, even though the subject matter is spiritual in nature.

There is no evidence of Buddhist teachings being reinterpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The text flows consistently without discernible interpolations or interlinear commentary. Strong indicators of oral transmission include the opening formula 'Thus have I heard' and the repetitive nature of dialogues, which aids memorization and recitation. No significant abbreviations are used. Sentence subjects are often omitted when clear from context, reflecting classical Chinese grammatical patterns.

The focus is spiritual, emphasizing devotion to Amitabha and the path to the Pure Land. There is no explicit evidence in this text of Buddhist teachings being interpreted through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts. The presence of bracketed notes and section headers indicates interpolations, and one note serves as an interlinear commentary. The repetitive structure is highly conducive to chanting and oral transmission. Subjects are often implicitly understood, and tense is generally unspecified, both common in classical Chinese. The character 諸 (zhu) is frequently used for plural forms.",

It is terse and uses plain language, focusing on conveying spiritual concepts related to Amitabha Buddha and the Pure Land. There are no clear Chinese idioms or indigenous Chinese philosophical interpretations. Sentence subjects are often implicit. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plurals.

The syllable count of 9 is an approximation for the transliterated dhāraṇī lines, which typically range from 8 to 10 syllables per name; the prose sections do not adhere to a fixed syllable count per line. The translation style is direct and literal, aiming to preserve the original Indic meaning, sometimes at the expense of fluent Chinese prose. The language is literary and largely plain, without extensive ornate flourishes, though it is verbose in its detailed descriptions and enumerations. Tense is explicitly indicated through temporal adverbs such as '今' (now), '昔' (formerly), and '當' (will/should), as well as through contextual cues, rather than through verb morphology. The text shows signs of oral transmission through its formulaic openings and repetitions, and contains what appear to be interpolations, particularly in the detailed prophecies regarding the decline of the Dharma and instructions for its propagation.",

Its style likely involved extensive lists of names and their associated powers, leading to a somewhat repetitive structure. The translation style is primarily literal, especially in its transliteration of Indic names, often followed immediately by a Chinese 'meaning' (字) and a description of the deity's function. This integrated explanatory style, where the 'meaning' and function are woven directly into the text (e.g., ""神名枝活吒貨[椽/土]字淨自在此神主護某頭""), can be seen as a form of interpolation or extensive glossing by the translator, making the foreign concepts more accessible to a Chinese audience. The language is literary Chinese but remains plain and functional rather than ornate. Due to the extensive listings of deities and their protective roles, the text becomes verbose. It frequently employs explicit sentence subjects, particularly in dialogue and when introducing new agents (e.g., ""佛言阿難""). Repetitive phrases and a call-and-response format (between Buddha and Ananda) suggest characteristics of oral transmission. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is consistently used to indicate plurals.

While the language is literary, it is generally plain and functional rather than ornate, focusing on the clear presentation of teachings, lists of guardian spirits, and karmic consequences. The extensive lists and repetitions contribute to a verbose style, emphasizing detailed enumeration for spiritual protection. The presence of parenthetical notes like '(漢言善光主疾病)' confirms interlinear commentary, and '(此神名丹本無)' explicitly indicates interpolations. The narrative flow and repetitive phrasing suggest an influence of oral transmission. Many sentence subjects are explicitly stated, especially in dialogue. The adverb '諸' (zhū) is frequently used to denote plural forms (e.g., 諸佛, 諸鬼神). Tense is generally left unspecified, as is common in classical Chinese.

The language is plain and descriptive rather than ornate, but its repetitive nature, particularly in detailing the benefits of wearing the divine names, makes it lean towards verbosity. No distinct Chinese idioms are evident. The content is overtly spiritual, focusing on divine protection and warding off evil spirits and calamities. There's no clear evidence of indigenous Chinese philosophical reinterpretation within this snippet. While definitive proof of interpolations or interlinear commentary is absent from the text itself, the structure with transliterated names and corresponding Chinese 'titles' is a common translational strategy. However, the dialogue format and repetitive phrasing strongly suggest a style rooted in oral transmission. Sentence subjects are frequently explicit. The pluralizer '諸' (zhū) is commonly used.

The translation style exhibits characteristics of early Chinese Buddhist translations from Indic languages, including formulaic expressions ('聞如是'), literal transliterations of names, and a somewhat verbose, repetitive style indicative of a tradition emphasizing oral transmission. The language is literary but plain, avoiding ornate flourishes. While subjects are sometimes explicit, implicit subjects are common following classical Chinese grammatical patterns. The text also includes a section justifying the use of 'miscellaneous' practices for future corrupt ages, which is a common trope in Mahayana sutras rather than a distinct interpolation.",

Its tone would have been spiritual, addressing core Buddhist concepts like karma, rebirth, nirvana, and the efficacy of ritual practices. Given the nature of sutras, it would probably have been verbose, with explanations and repetitions common in oral traditions. Translation Style (Chinese):1. Verse, prose, or mixed: The text is predominantly prose, used for narrative and dialogue. However, it contains distinct sections of transliterated dharanis, which are not Chinese verse and do not adhere to a consistent syllable count.2. Syllables per line: As the primary text is prose, a single syllable count per line is not applicable. The embedded dharani sections have varying syllable counts per phrase, typically ranging from 6 to 9 syllables. Therefore, 0 is returned to indicate no consistent verse structure.3. Vernacular or literary: The translation is in literary Chinese, consistent with early Buddhist translations. It employs classical grammar and vocabulary, aiming for a formal register, distinct from everyday vernacular.4. Literal or fluent: The translation style is largely literal. This is evidenced by direct renderings like ""聞如是"" (thus have I heard) from Sanskrit *evam mayā śrutam*, and often preserves original sentence structures. The dharani sections are direct transliterations.5. Ornate or plain language: The language is plain and direct, prioritizing the clear conveyance of Buddhist teachings and narratives over elaborate or decorative literary style.6. Terse or verbose: The text is verbose, characterized by detailed explanations, frequent reiteration of questions and answers (e.g., Ananda's repeated inquiries and the Buddha's detailed responses), and extensive descriptions, all contributing to a comprehensive but lengthy exposition.7. Idioms used: Few, if any, distinct Chinese idioms are used. The translation adheres to a direct, expository style, minimizing idiomatic expressions.8. Factual or spiritual: The tone is decidedly spiritual, focusing on Buddhist doctrines such as nirvana, karma, different realms of existence (heavens, hells, hungry ghosts), the Three Jewels, and the power of dharanis against spirits.9. Indigenous Chinese: Buddhist teachings are interpreted with references to indigenous Chinese philosophical and cultural concepts. This is clearly shown by the mention of ""震旦國"" (China), its unique funeral customs, and the reference to ""三聖"" (Three Sages) within China, indicating an adaptation for the local audience.10. Interpolations: The detailed and specific descriptions of Chinese geography, funeral practices, and the ""Three Sages"" in China strongly suggest interpolations or significant localized adaptations by the translator, making the text more culturally relevant to a Chinese audience.11. Interlinear commentary: There is no interlinear commentary present in the provided text.12. Oral transmission: Signs of oral transmission are evident through the opening formula ""聞如是,"" the repetitive question-and-answer dialogue structures, and exhortations like ""諦聽諦受"" (listen carefully, accept carefully), which are typical features of orally transmitted teachings.13. Abbreviations: No discernible abbreviations of Chinese characters or Buddhist terms are used within the text.14. Explicit sentence subject: The text frequently uses explicit sentence subjects, especially in dialogue (e.g., ""佛告賢者阿難,"" ""賢者阿難復白佛言""), contributing to a direct, though sometimes less fluid, translation style.15. Plural zhu: The character 諸 (zhū) is extensively used to indicate plural forms (e.g., ""諸佛,"" ""諸眾生,"" ""諸菩薩僧"").16. Tense: Tense is primarily left unspecified, relying on context and temporal markers (such as ""後"" for 'after') rather than explicit grammatical verb conjugations, which is characteristic of Classical Chinese.",

There is no overt interpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophical lenses. The interlinear note '胡言文頭婁者晉言神印也' explicitly clarifies a foreign term, serving as both an interpolation and interlinear commentary. The opening '聞如是' and repetitive structure, especially in the mantra sections and dialogue, suggest characteristics of oral transmission. Sentence subjects are frequently omitted, relying on context.

It is not overly ornate but maintains a formal, literary tone. The translation exhibits a tendency towards literalness, sometimes resulting in repetitive phrasing and a somewhat rigid sentence structure, characteristic of early Buddhist translations attempting to closely follow the Indic source. The language is plain and functional, primarily focused on conveying information, instructions, and the benefits of the dharanis. It avoids elaborate literary embellishments or highly aesthetic descriptions. The text is verbose, characterized by frequent repetition of phrases, formulaic statements, and extensive listings of benefits and conditions, which contributes to an emphasized but not always concise style.

The language tends towards a functional vernacular for its time, employing straightforward sentence structures and direct explanations. The translation is notably literal, often mirroring Indic syntax and using direct renderings like '是謂' (this is called/this means), which can sometimes make the Chinese feel less fluent. It uses plain language without ornate metaphors or complex rhetorical devices. The wording is verbose, frequently repeating structures (e.g., '云何X...是謂X') and providing extensive, detailed explanations. No distinct Chinese idioms are used.

The verbose nature and the systematic, almost exhaustive, listing of attributes or conditions are highly characteristic of Indic Buddhist sutras, serving mnemonic and emphatic purposes. Translation Style: The Chinese translation demonstrates a highly literal approach, aiming for fidelity to the Sanskrit source. This preserves the original's verbosity, long descriptive lists, and frequent use of negations.

The translation style is quite literal, sometimes closely mirroring the Indic source's syntax which can make the Chinese less fluent. It uses formal, literary Chinese. The language is plain and descriptive, rather than ornate, and quite verbose in its detailed enumeration of corrupted practices. There are no prominent Chinese idioms. While the subject is spiritual, the tone is factual, describing concrete behaviors of monks and societal decay. There is no clear reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophy in this excerpt. One instance of interlinear commentary (晉言日善) is present. The direct address and sermon-like opening indicate an oral transmission style. Subjects are frequently omitted, characteristic of classical Chinese, though some are explicit. The pluralizer 諸 (zhu) is widely used. Tense is inferred from context and temporal markers like '當來之世' (in future times), rather than being explicitly marked on verbs.",
大沙門羯磨,T 1438,prose,0,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,factual,False,True,True,True,explicit,True,unspecified,False,False,False,"The source text, being an Indic Vinaya text, would inherently be formulaic and repetitive, designed for oral recitation and precision in monastic legal procedures. The translation style largely preserves these characteristics. The text is composed in functional literary Chinese, which, while not modern vernacular, avoids the highly ornate or classical style, prioritizing clarity for practical application. It is notably verbose due to the extensive repetitions required for formal monastic 'karma' (羯磨) procedures, where each step and participant's role must be clearly articulated and affirmed. The presence of direct transliterations for key Buddhist technical terms (e.g., 僧伽婆尸沙, 波利婆沙, 摩那埵) rather than interpretive translations or indigenous Chinese correlatives indicates a literal translation approach focused on fidelity to the original disciplinary terms. This aligns with a 'factual' tone, as the text deals with concrete monastic rules and transgressions rather than abstract spiritual concepts. The explicit use of subjects like '僧' (Sangha) and '我某甲比丘' (I, so-and-so bhikkhu) throughout the ritual formulas enhances clarity regarding the agent of each action, which is crucial in a legal context, making sentence subjects more explicit than in general classical Chinese. The frequent use of '諸' (all/plural) before titles like '長老' (elders) and '比丘' (bhikkhus) explicitly marks plural forms. Tense is generally left unspecified, as is common in classical Chinese, relying on context for temporal understanding. The presence of parenthetical notes, such as explanations of '波利婆沙' or lists of roles, indicates both interlinear commentary and interpolations by later editors or commentators.",

The verse section predominantly uses lines of 5 characters. The language is classical literary Chinese, not modern vernacular. The translation style tends towards literalness, sometimes resulting in less natural Chinese phrasing but aiming for fidelity to the source. The language used is generally plain and straightforward, without ornate embellishments. The narrative is quite detailed and expansive, particularly in describing Mara's various attempts and the karmic consequences, leaning towards verbose. No distinct Chinese idioms were identified. The tone is distinctly spiritual, utilizing terms like 'samādhi' (三昧) and focusing on Buddhist doctrines of karma, suffering, and liberation. There is no overt reinterpretation of Buddhist concepts through indigenous Chinese philosophical frameworks. The text does not appear to contain interpolations or interlinear commentary. Signs of oral transmission are present, such as formulaic phrases and repetitive narrative structures (e.g., stock epithets, repeated descriptions of Mara's tactics and their results). Sentence subjects are frequently explicit, especially when introducing actions and dialogue. The character '諸' (zhū) is widely used to denote plural forms (e.g., 諸沙門, 諸比丘). Tense is not grammatically marked and is inferred from context and temporal adverbs. No abbreviations are evident in the text.",

The translation by Jùqú Jīngshēng adopts a literary Chinese style that is generally literal, directly rendering phrases and sentence structures from the Indic original. This leads to a somewhat stiff, but clear, prose. The language is plain rather than ornate, focusing on narrative and doctrinal clarity. The text is verbose, characterized by repetitions and formulaic phrases, which are typical of orally transmitted Buddhist texts. There are no distinct Chinese idioms used. The term '禪定' (chán dìng, meditation/concentration) is used, aligning with a factual description of practice. A notable aspect of the translation is the strong emphasis on filial piety (孝, xiào), with the Buddha's act of personally carrying his father's coffin presented as a model for 'unfilial' beings, clearly interpreting Buddhist teachings through an indigenous Chinese philosophical lens. Sentence subjects are generally explicit, aiding clarity in translation. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is frequently used to indicate plural forms. Tense is primarily indicated through temporal adverbs and context, rather than explicit verbal inflections.",

The prose sections are straightforward and contextual, while the verse section (referred to as '義足經') is highly terse, with lines predominantly consisting of six syllables. The translation style is distinctly literal and vernacular, indicative of early Chinese Buddhist translations that prioritized direct semantic transfer over elegant literary expression. This results in plain language, a lack of ornate phrasing, and often a very direct, unadorned syntax. There are no obvious Chinese idioms or indigenous philosophical interpretations embedded in the text. Tense is generally unspecified, as is common in Classical Chinese. The use of '諸' to denote plural (e.g., '諸比丘') is present. The text explicitly mentions '聞如是' (Thus have I heard), a clear sign of its origins in an oral tradition.",

The language is literary rather than vernacular, employing classical Chinese sentence structures. There is no evidence of indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts being used to interpret Buddhist teachings, nor are Chinese idioms or abbreviations present. Sentence subjects are frequently implicit, and tense is generally unspecified. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is used to indicate plural forms.

There's a clear distinction between the prose narrative and the verse dialogues. The use of '聞如是' indicates its origin in oral tradition. The language is classical and plain, lacking overt Chinese literary embellishments, focusing on conveying the Buddhist concepts directly.

The verse sections predominantly feature lines of six syllables, though some lines consist of five syllables. The language is a distinctive 'translationese' form of literary Chinese, characterized by its literal rendering of the Indic source, often resulting in terse, sometimes fragmented, and awkward phrasing that prioritizes direct meaning over fluent Chinese syntax. This literalism makes it lean towards 'plain' language rather than ornate. While classical Chinese commonly uses implicit subjects, this translation frequently makes subjects explicit, sometimes creating a somewhat heavy or repetitive feel, though it also employs implicit subjects when the context is clear. Tense is largely unspecified, relying on context and temporal adverbs like '爾時' (at that time) and '今' (now). The presence of '聞如是' (Thus have I heard) and descriptive narrative elements suggests an origin in oral transmission. The adverb 諸 (zhū) is used to denote plurality (e.g., 諸學人).",

The verse sections primarily feature 5-syllable lines, though a significant later section (the transformed Buddha's teaching) uses 6-syllable lines. The translation is quite literal, often leading to less fluent Chinese phrasing, consistent with early Buddhist translations from Indic languages. An explanatory note ('何故？一切制念度故。') embedded within the narrative is considered an interpolation. The style reflects characteristics of early Chinese Buddhist translations, preserving elements of oral transmission and a focus on direct meaning over stylistic embellishment. Buddhist teachings are presented without obvious reinterpretation through indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts.",

The translation renders it into literary Chinese prose. The style is generally fluent, conveying the meaning effectively, though some constructions (e.g., extensive use of '皆' for universality, long descriptive clauses) might subtly reflect the Indic original's structure. The language is elevated but not overly ornate, aiming for clarity and dignity. It tends to be verbose in its descriptions. While the text uses classical phrasing and Buddhist technical terms, it doesn't extensively employ common Chinese idiomatic expressions. The tone is distinctly spiritual, focusing on the Bodhisattva's compassionate actions and the path to enlightenment, using terms like '四等心' (four immeasurables) and '佛道' (Buddha-path).

The majority of the '讚曰' (praise) verses are heptasyllabic (7 characters per line), but some verses (gāthās) attributed to Yama are pentasyllabic (5 characters per line). The core prose translation tends to be relatively literal, conveying Indic concepts directly, while the appended '讚曰' verses are fluent and adapted to Chinese poetic forms, summarizing the preceding prose. The text shows strong influence of indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts and practices, particularly in the detailed systematization of the Ten Kings of Hell (十王), the ritual of '生七' (seven-day observances for the deceased), and references to Chinese administrative structures like '六曹'. This suggests a sinicization of Buddhist afterlife concepts. The text contains several interpolations: prefaces, concluding remarks ('成化五年六月日誌'), and the numerous '讚曰' verses, which are elaborations or summaries added in Chinese poetic form, not direct translations from an Indic original. The presence of numerous '讚曰' sections, which summarize or reiterate the prose, and direct exhortations, suggests the text was intended for recitation, chanting, or public exposition, indicative of practices related to oral transmission.",
