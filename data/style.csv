四十二章經,T 784,prose,0,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,implicit,True,unspecified,False,True,False,"The text is an early Chinese Buddhist translation from an Indic language, likely Sanskrit, given its characteristics. The translation style is notably literal, often directly mirroring the structure and repetitive nature of the source text, which leads to a verbose and formulaic presentation in Chinese. This verbosity and repetition also suggest features of oral transmission from the source. The language is plain, focusing on clarity rather than ornate expression. It primarily uses implicit sentence subjects, common in classical Chinese and early Buddhist translations. The spiritual tone is pronounced, with a strong emphasis on karmic consequences and monastic discipline. The use of '諸' for plurals and '為' as a copula are typical of this period of translation. There is no evidence of indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts reinterpreting the Buddhist teachings.",,
陰持入經,T 603,prose,0,vernacular,literal,plain,terse,False,factual,False,False,False,True,explicit,True,unspecified,False,True,True,"The text is primarily prose. The syllable count is not applicable to prose, hence 0. The language style is characteristic of early Han dynasty 'translationese,' which often results in a direct, somewhat unpolished style, here categorized as 'vernacular' rather than classical literary Chinese. While the text employs a generally terse wording for individual concepts, its frequent repetition of phrases and enumerations can give an overall impression of verbosity. Sentence subjects are often made explicit for clarity, although they can be implicit in enumerative lists. The style frequently uses '是為' (shi wei) and '名為' (ming wei) as copulas, and '謂' (wei) as 'namely' or 'is called', reflecting a literal translation approach. The repetitive structure and direct, explanatory tone are strong indicators of oral transmission practices during the translation process.",,
大道地經,T 607,prose,0,literary,literal,plain,verbose,False,spiritual,False,False,False,True,explicit,True,unspecified,False,True,False,"The text is predominantly prose, used for explanations, narratives, and enumerations. While some opening sections of chapters contain poetic lines or gathas, these are not consistently metered and do not constitute formal verse throughout the text. Therefore, 'prose' is selected as the main style, and syllables_per_line is set to 0. The translation style is quite literal, often directly reflecting the Indic source, which sometimes results in less fluent or concise Chinese. This literalness, combined with extensive use of similes ('譬如') and detailed enumerations (e.g., diseases, body parts, observations), contributes to a verbose rather than terse style, especially in descriptive passages. The frequent use of explicit sentence subjects is also characteristic of a literal translation approach from an Indic language. Signs of oral transmission, such as direct address to the practitioner ('行道者當知'), repetitive phrases, and the use of similes, are evident.",,
