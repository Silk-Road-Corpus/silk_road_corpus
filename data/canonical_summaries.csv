This wisdom reveals that all phenomena—including the Bodhisattva, Buddha, and Prajñāpāramitā itself—are merely conventional designations, ultimately empty of inherent existence.

It instructs Bodhisattvas to cultivate a mind of non-abiding, realizing the inherent emptiness of all phenomena—including the path, its stages, and even the concept of Bodhisattvas themselves—as merely conventional designations without intrinsic existence. Through this profound understanding and non-clinging, the Bodhisattva progresses towards omniscient wisdom (Sarvajñatā), embodying skillful means to benefit sentient beings and purify Buddha-lands without falling into dualistic views or lower vehicle attainments.

This adamantine resolve (saṃnāha) manifests as tireless compassionate action, like an illusionist helping illusory beings, ultimately leading to Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi through a deep realization of all existence as unproduced, unbound, and unreleased.

It asserts that Mahāyāna is precisely identical to Prajñāpāramitā, emphasizing that all dharmas, from the five skandhas to Buddhahood, are inherently unproduced (不生), empty, tranquil, and merely conceptual designations, without true beginning, end, or middle. A Bodhisattva practicing this Prajñāpāramitā contemplates all phenomena as empty and illusory, thereby detaching from all dualistic views and conventional distinctions, which allows for pure, unattached action and the realization of omniscience (Sarvajñā). This profound insight into the non-duality and uncreated nature of all reality is deemed the 'mother of all good dharmas,' enabling Bodhisattvas and Buddhas of all times to achieve supreme enlightenment while maintaining great compassion."

It extensively utilizes analogies like illusions, dreams, and echoes to demonstrate that all dharmas—from sentient beings and the skandhas to Buddhahood itself—are unproduced, ungraspable, and beyond conceptualization, highlighting that true wisdom transcends dualistic apprehension and linguistic expression. This profound and boundless practice, rooted in great compassion and skillful means, not only protects its practitioners from hindrances and leads to the attainment of omniscience by perceiving all things as non-arising and non-ceasing, but also encompasses all wholesome qualities and guides beings to liberation without any self-centered attachment or conceit."

This supremacy stems from Prajñāpāramitā being the source of all enlightenment, expounding the undefiled Dharma, emptiness, and non-dualistic wisdom which are foundational for all paths from Stream-entry to Buddhahood. The Sūtra consistently emphasizes that true practice of the Six Pāramitās and accumulation of merit must be free from attachment, conceptualization, and dualistic views to be genuinely transformative and ""unpoisoned.""

Proper deportment, therefore, embodies this profound wisdom and emptiness, guiding the elimination of defilements by recognizing their fundamental purity and non-arising nature, thus establishing the bodhisattva's ethical and spiritual framework."

The ""Honeyball Sutta"" features Elder Mahākātyāyana's detailed exposition on how non-attachment to the six sense bases leads to the cessation of suffering, a teaching later affirmed by the Buddha as universally applicable like a honeyball's taste.

He then enlightened King Kuru by explaining his renunciation was based not on worldly misfortunes but on four fundamental truths taught by the Buddha: the world offers no ultimate protection, is subject to aging, is impermanent and must be forsaken, and is insatiable due to craving.

Subsequently, the prominent Jaina lay follower Upāli confidently challenged the Buddha on this very point, but was ultimately convinced by the Buddha's incisive arguments and illustrations that mind-karma is the most significant.

The Buddha then extensively details the profound qualities and practices of Bodhisattvas, emphasizing their tireless pursuit of wisdom and selfless compassion for all beings, which merits ultimate reverence and provides unconditioned Dharma joy far surpassing any worldly offerings.

These prescribed practices include impurity contemplation, loving-kindness, dependent origination, mindfulness of breath (Anapanasati), and Buddha remembrance, each outlined with progressive stages from novice to advanced. By engaging in these systematic contemplative exercises, the text guides practitioners towards purifying the mind, cultivating wisdom, and ultimately achieving various stages of samadhi and liberation."

It then details the paths to liberation for Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas, explaining practices such as the four foundations of mindfulness, the twelve links of dependent origination, and the four noble truths to break free from suffering. Specific meditation techniques are prescribed to directly counteract the three poisons—impurity contemplation for lust, loving-kindness for hatred, and dependent origination for ignorance—emphasizing the crucial role of skillful means and right timing in spiritual advancement towards nirvana or the ultimate Bodhisattva goal."

These narratives, drawn from various realms including monks, kings, commoners, animals, and celestial beings, illuminate the intricate workings of karma and retribution across countless lifetimes. Emphasizing the transient nature of existence and the importance of right understanding and compassionate action, the text serves as a powerful pedagogical tool. Through these engaging analogies, it guides practitioners towards genuine spiritual insight and the path to liberation from suffering."

The commentary then addresses why the Buddha preached this sutra, providing numerous reasons, chiefly to reveal the bodhisattva path and the ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya) that transcends worldly, individual, and remedial doctrines. Finally, it meticulously deconstructs the phrase ""Thus Have I Heard, at one time,"" explaining that ""I,"" ""heard,"" ""one,"" and ""time"" are merely conventional designations, guiding practitioners to transcend reified concepts and grasp the emptiness of all phenomena."

It then elaborates on ""Bhagavān,"" defining him as one endowed with virtues and great renown, who has completely eradicated lust, hatred, and delusion, a feat superior to that of Arhats who retain subtle traces. The treatise further defends the Buddha's omniscience against various philosophical objections, asserting that he knows all but teaches selectively for the benefit of beings. His profound wisdom is also evident in his strategic non-answers to certain unanswerable questions, affirming his unparalleled enlightened state."

It then describes the illustrious assembly as comprising five thousand great Arhats, whose minds are fully liberated from all defilements, having accomplished their spiritual tasks and achieved profound wisdom and tranquility. The text highlights Ananda as the sole exception among them, still a Stream-Enterer due to his specific vows and circumstances, and also includes five hundred Bhikṣuṇīs, Upāsakas, and Upāsikās, all of whom have realized the Noble Truths. This intricate commentary thus establishes the auspicious context and the highly advanced spiritual qualifications of the sūtra's recipients."

It meticulously details the Bodhisattva's immense cultivation, including the progression through three immeasurable eons, the fulfillment of the Six Paramitas, and the accumulation of merits for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man. The commentary then critically contrasts this extensive Mahayana understanding of the Bodhisattva path with more limited Shravaka interpretations, particularly regarding the timing of Buddhahood, the nature of ultimate wisdom, and the presence of Buddhas across countless worlds. Ultimately, it portrays the Bodhisattva as one driven by unwavering compassion and wisdom, dedicated to attaining complete Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings."

It details their profound spiritual attainments, including various dhāraṇīs (mnemonic powers), numerous samādhis (meditative absorptions) especially the three gates of liberation (emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness), and equal forbearance towards all beings and phenomena. Furthermore, Mahāsattvas embody unwavering diligence, renounce worldly gain and fame, possess supernatural powers, and skillfully teach the Dharma without any self-serving expectations. Their ultimate aim, rooted in vast vows spanning immeasurable eons, is to transcend all obstacles—including karmic obscurations and demonic influences—to liberate countless beings from suffering and lead them to unconditioned happiness."
322,大智論,T 1509 (6),$nti/t1509_06.txt,"The text from Nagarjuna's *Da zhidu lun* explicates ten similes—such as illusion, mirage, and dream—to demonstrate that all phenomena, though conventionally perceived, lack inherent self-nature, thereby illustrating the profound concept of emptiness. It addresses the seeming contradiction between emptiness and perception by clarifying that emptiness denotes the absence of inherent existence, allowing for phenomena to arise dependently and be distinguishable despite their ultimate unreality, akin to a magician's creations. The treatise further details the advanced qualities of bodhisattvas, who possess unobstructed wisdom, fearlessness, subtle insight into beings' minds, unhindered equanimity, and great patience to skillfully liberate them by revealing the non-dualistic and fundamentally pure nature of reality. This liberation emphasizes an ultimate understanding where defilements and enlightenment are seen as unhindered and equal."

They also practice a profound Buddha-contemplation samadhi, which uniquely purifies all afflictions and accumulates vast merit, enabling them to compassionately invite Buddhas to teach the Dharma and prolong their stay in the world. The Buddha then enters the supreme 'Samadhi King Samadhi,' a state of perfect mastery, from which he emerges with a full-body smile, radiating boundless light from every pore to illuminate countless worlds. This universal radiance serves to awaken all sentient beings, ensuring that any who encounter its transformative power will inevitably attain complete enlightenment, signifying the profound start of the Prajñāpāramitā teachings."

Next, the Buddha manifests a vast, broad tongue from which jeweled lotus flowers emerge, each bearing a manifested Buddha expounding the Six Perfections, thereby validating the profound Prajnaparamita teaching. Finally, entering the Lion's Play Samadhi, the Buddha causes the world to quake, liberating beings from lower realms and difficult states into heavenly rebirths, while simultaneously healing physical ailments and fostering universal compassion, moral conduct, and tranquil wisdom among all."

It further explains that the Buddha's divine ability allows all beings to perceive him individually and facilitates mutual vision across countless Buddha-worlds, demonstrating a power far beyond ordinary or even arhat perception. The commentary then rigorously refutes the notion of a singular Buddha, clarifying that scriptural statements like ""no two Buddhas in one world"" are expedient teachings referring to limited spheres or to inspire diligence, not an absolute denial of innumerable Buddhas throughout the ten directions. It concludes that any failure to perceive these omnipresent saviors is attributed to sentient beings' deep karmic obstructions rather than the Buddhas' non-existence."

It highlights the spiritual resilience cultivated in the challenging Saha world and depicts Shakyamuni Buddha's reciprocal act of scattering flowers, transforming the world into a jeweled realm where Bodhisattvas on each flower teach the Six Paramitas, inspiring all assembled beings towards supreme enlightenment."

It then describes Prajñāpāramitā as an ultimately inexpressible wisdom that enables Bodhisattvas to perfectly practice dāna (generosity) without attachment to giver, receiver, or gift, detailing the myriad benefits of such pure giving. The text further distinguishes Dharma-dāna (teaching the Dharma) as superior to material dāna, being immeasurable and inexhaustible, crucial for generating all virtues and ultimately leading beings to Buddhahood."

For Bodhisattvas, this perfection is realized through unwavering, selfless giving—even of one's own body and family—for the sake of all beings, understanding the ultimate emptiness of the giver, receiver, and gift, a ""threefold purity."" This profound giving, unlike the limited practice of Arhats, fully manifests across both their karmic and Dharma bodies through immense sacrifices and compassionate acts in all realms. Ultimately, Dāna-pāramitā reaches its zenith when it generates and integrates all other five perfections (precepts, patience, vigor, meditation, and wisdom), leading to ultimate liberation and the realization of Buddhahood."
322,大智論,T 1509 (13),$nti/t1509_13.txt,"This text from the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra expounds Śīlapāramitā, defining precepts as wholesome conduct and self-restraint, which are the fundamental support for all virtuous dharmas whether formally undertaken or naturally practiced. Upholding these moral principles, including the five lay precepts, leads to auspicious rebirths, freedom from suffering, and ultimately liberation, while their transgression results in severe karmic retribution and misfortune in this life and beyond. The discourse explains the specific characteristics of various precepts, from basic lay vows to monastic disciplines, highlighting their profound benefits such as enduring happiness, esteemed reputation, and the gradual progression towards Arhatship, Pratyekabuddhahood, or supreme Buddhahood. It underscores that while initial adherence might be motivated by worldly rewards, the ultimate purpose of pure precept practice, especially with great compassion, is to achieve the unsurpassed Buddha-path."

It explains that true morality is ultimately understood through the emptiness of good and evil, and even sentient beings themselves, transcending conventional distinctions. Subsequently, the text delves into Kṣāntipāramitā, or the perfection of patience, exemplified by tales such as the Kṣānti Ṛṣi enduring mutilation and the Buddha resisting Mara's temptations, encompassing both patience with beings and with phenomena. This profound patience is cultivated by seeing adversaries as teachers, understanding karmic causality, and fostering immense compassion based on the impermanent and ultimately empty nature of all existence."
322,大智論,T 1509 (15),$nti/t1509_15.txt,"The text defines Dharma-kshanti (法忍) as enduring phenomena, unlike sentient-being-kshanti (生忍) which endures beings. It involves not clinging to internal or external stimuli, recognizing their inherent emptiness and non-duality, as exemplified by profound non-dual teachings. This patience extends to both non-mental hardships (like cold or hunger) and internal afflictions (such as anger or lust), which Bodhisattvas endure through wisdom and contemplation, without necessarily severing these afflictions but skillfully restraining them. Ultimately, Dharma-kshanti signifies an unwavering faith in the profound Middle Way and the unconditioned, true nature of reality, enabling the Bodhisattva to navigate all phenomena for the sake of enlightenment and benefiting sentient beings."
322,大智論,T 1509 (16),$nti/t1509_16.txt,"The text expounds on virya (diligence), defining it as firm resolve, an untiring mind, and persistent effort to complete tasks, exemplified by continuous physical and mental exertion in wholesome deeds. However, virya-paramita (perfection of diligence) distinguishes itself as an effort exclusively aimed at attaining Buddhahood for the liberation of all sentient beings, driven by great compassion and the wisdom of ultimate reality. This supreme diligence manifests as boundless and selfless dedication across countless lives, wherein Bodhisattvas make immense sacrifices and tirelessly cultivate all other perfections. Even while realizing the ultimate emptiness of all phenomena, this true virya-paramita remains an unceasing, unconditioned endeavor to benefit and guide all beings until they achieve enlightenment."

While ordinary meritorious deeds offer temporary joys, Dhyāna leads to the permanent bliss of Nirvana, achieved through diligent practice that involves rejecting sense-desires and eliminating mental hindrances like greed, anger, and doubt. For Bodhisattvas, Dhyāna becomes a Pāramitā when it is practiced without attachment to its pleasant experiences (不味) and without being disturbed by defilements (不亂), fueled instead by immense compassion for all beings and an insight into the emptiness of all phenomena. This enables Bodhisattvas to manifest in countless forms, teaching the Dharma even from deep meditative states."

It is deemed ""great"" because it gives rise to all Buddhas and other noble beings, encompassing all forms of wisdom and leading to the supreme, unchanging fruit of Nirvana, unlike limited worldly attainments. This wisdom differs from outer paths by perceiving phenomena as primordially empty, transcending both nihilism and attachment to conceptual frameworks, though it can still understand diverse dharmas through skillful means. Ultimately, Bodhisattvas cultivate all perfections with profound compassion, realizing this non-abiding wisdom to effectively guide all sentient beings to liberation."

It explains that Bodhisattvas must learn all virtuous dharmas and paths, but uniquely practice these factors by realizing their ultimate emptiness and non-arising nature through Prajñāpāramitā, transforming Saṃsāra into Nirvāṇa without attachment or aversion. Unlike lesser vehicles, Bodhisattvas grasp the non-dual reality that ""Saṃsāra is Nirvāṇa"" and cultivate these factors as a foundation for profound wisdom, enabling them to dwell in the world while transcending its inherent characteristics.

The Eight Emancipations outline progressive stages of liberation from attachment to form and formless realms, starting with contemplating internal and external impurities and culminating in cessation. The Nine Contemplations focus on the body's decay through various stages of a corpse to overcome lust and attachment by realizing impermanence and impurity. Lastly, the Eight Recollections—meditations on the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, precepts, generosity, deities, breath, and death—serve to alleviate fear, cultivate wholesome qualities, and strengthen the resolve for liberation, providing a comprehensive framework for mental purification and insight."

It then extols the Sangha as an unsurpassed field of merit, illustrating its immeasurable virtues through a story of śrāmaṇas who reveal their spiritual attainments to a misjudging layperson. The discourse subsequently covers the recollection of precepts, giving (both material and Dharma), heavens, mindfulness of breath, and death, explaining their sequence and purpose for practitioners. Finally, it differentiates the eight recollections for Śrāvakas, who seek self-liberation, from those for Bodhisattvas, who aim for the liberation and complete wisdom of all sentient beings."

The text meticulously describes each of the ten powers, such as knowing what is possible and impossible, the results of karma, the spiritual faculties, and the dispositions of all beings, culminating in the knowledge of the exhaustion of defilements. It clarifies that learning these powers inspires practitioners, refutes detractors who doubt the Buddha's true abilities, and encourages Bodhisattvas on their arduous path by highlighting the ultimate fruits of Buddhahood.

It details how Bodhisattvas, through the practice of Prajñāpāramitā and skillful means, intentionally choose specific rebirths—such as in noble families or various heavens—to benefit sentient beings, purify Buddha-lands, and continually encounter Buddhas. The commentary resolves apparent contradictions between the ultimate emptiness of self and the conventional reality of rebirth by referencing the Two Truths doctrine, asserting that even seemingly negative experiences or actions of Bodhisattvas are skillful means to guide practitioners.

It describes various Bodhisattva manifestations, from Cakravartin Kings to Buddhas, who benefit sentient beings across countless realms and purify their own Buddha-lands by cultivating profound wisdom and the six paramitas. A Bodhisattva's impurity is defined as clinging to the notions of body, speech, or mind, while their true Buddha-path involves realizing the ultimate ungraspability and emptiness of all phenomena, making them invincible. This path culminates in the purification of the five eyes, especially the wisdom eye, which perceives all dharmas non-conceptually and without attachment."

Such Bodhisattvas develop an equal mind towards all, recognize the ultimate equality of all phenomena, and are affirmed by the Buddha as the very source of all good in the world, including human and heavenly realms and the arising of all enlightened beings.

Guided by the Buddha, Subhūti demonstrates that a Bodhisattva practicing Prajñāpāramitā must perceive all dharmas as ultimately empty and ungraspable, transcending attachment to any concept, including the path itself. This realization, involving ""name, recipient, and dharma"" fictional designations, enables cultivation of virtues without clinging, leading to an ""unmoved"" mind devoid of fear or regret. Therefore, to achieve all merits and avoid ""falling from the summit"" due to attachment to dharma, all practitioners of the three vehicles must diligently study and abide in this profound wisdom of Prajñāpāramitā."

Through profound understanding that all phenomena, including spiritual paths and ultimate truths, are empty and 'non-receivable,' this 'non-abiding' wisdom, exemplified by the ascetic Sañjaya, defines the Bodhisattva's unique path, surpassing the Two Vehicles and culminating in omniscience."

It strongly emphasizes that a Bodhisattva must cultivate this wisdom without any attachment to concepts, ""marks"" (行相), or even the idea of their own practice, as any form of grasping signifies a lack of skillful means (upaya) and impedes liberation. This non-conceptual engagement with reality, encompassing numerous profound samadhis that are fundamentally non-dual with Prajnaparamita and the practitioner, purifies the mind, eradicates defilements, and leads swiftly to supreme enlightenment.

The discourse further clarifies that ""the meaning of a Bodhisattva's terms"" is ""no meaning,"" using numerous similes to demonstrate that all dharmas, even the Buddha's qualities, are ultimately empty, unborn, and without fixed reality.

The discussion further clarifies that a Mahāsattva discerns and abandons all erroneous views, even wholesome ones, and practices with an all-encompassing mind that does not cling to any phenomena, including itself, due to the inherent emptiness of all dharmas.

This is because all dharmas are ultimately empty and devoid of inherent nature or fixed emergence.

He explains that because all phenomena are ultimately unborn and unceasing, they are non-dual with Prajnaparamita itself, which is this ultimate unbornness.

Subhūti asks the Buddha how Bodhisattvas learn and enter emptiness, non-sign, and non-action samādhis, as well as the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment, without making a final realization. The Buddha explains that Bodhisattvas, driven by great compassion and a vow to save all beings, intentionally view their practice as a ""time for learning"" rather than ""a time for certifying,"" thus avoiding the certification of ultimate reality that would lead to Hinayana stages. They continue to accumulate good roots and skillful means, like a skilled archer delaying the fall of their arrows, until full Buddhahood is achieved for the benefit of all."

The Buddha emphasizes that cultivating and teaching this profound wisdom generates merit far superior to any other good deeds, while cautioning against doubts, clinging to false views, or engaging in disputes that hinder progress. Bodhisattvas are urged to view fellow practitioners as Buddhas and to learn the ""equal dharmas"" – the emptiness of all internal and external phenomena and their ultimate uncreated, non-abiding ""suchness."" This practice, free from conceptual grasping, leads to irreversible advancement towards Omniscience, by recognizing that all dharmas ultimately abide in their non-dual, inherent reality."

It then delves into a deep dialogue between the Buddha and Subhūti, establishing that all phenomena, including the Pāramitās and even supreme enlightenment, are ultimately empty and non-differentiated, and this very emptiness is the basis for their realization. Subhūti clarifies that the true difficulty for Bodhisattvas lies not in avoiding Hinayana liberation while practicing this profound emptiness, but in vowing to save countless beings while knowing them to be ultimately non-existent, a practice that elicits reverence from all beings and Buddhas. Ultimately, Bodhisattvas practice Prajñāpāramitā by understanding this non-conceptual reality, transcending all differentiation, and remaining fearless in the face of universal emptiness, thereby attaining non-differentiated supreme enlightenment."

Bodhisattvas cultivate this 'non-attainment' wisdom by observing all elements as fundamentally empty and non-dual, thereby transcending lesser paths and overcoming Māra's temptations. The text further demonstrates how the practice of a single Pāramitā, like giving, can encompass and perfect all other perfections when dedicated with wisdom and skillful means towards supreme perfect enlightenment, ensuring unwavering progress toward Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi."

Each explanation underscores the Bodhisattva's unwavering commitment to supreme perfect enlightenment, benefiting all beings by transcending attachments to the act, the actor, and the object of practice.

The Buddha emphatically highlights Prajñāpāramitā (wisdom) as the supreme and guiding force among the Pāramitās, illustrating through numerous analogies how it enables and perfects the other five, leading to omniscience. Despite recognizing the ultimate emptiness and non-self-nature of all phenomena, Bodhisattvas are instructed to diligently cultivate these virtues with non-attachment and skillful means for the liberation of sentient beings, without clinging to any concept, including emptiness itself.

The path to all-knowledge is not through conventional ""cultivation"" but by realizing that all dharmas, including the path and its goal, are ""unspeakable,"" ""neither increasing nor decreasing,"" and empty of inherent characteristics, leading to a state of ""non-attainment.""

Prajñāpāramitā is revealed as the wisdom that transcends all conceptual dualities and reaches the ""other shore"" by realizing the emptiness of all things.

This practice, which yields immeasurable merit and purifies Buddha lands, is not for conventional gain or even for the good roots themselves, but for supreme enlightenment.

The Buddha clarifies that any conceptualization, even of the path's stages or fruits, constitutes *prapañca*, and true liberation arises from realizing the ""no-characteristic"" nature of reality, which transcends both existence and non-existence. Bodhisattvas comprehensively learn all paths through ""knowledge of all aspects of the path"" (*daoji-jnana*), cultivating the ""destruction"" of phenomena by not clinging to their perceived existence or non-existence.

This non-dualistic approach allows a bodhisattva to fulfill myriad practices in a single thought-moment, thereby traversing the bodhisattva grounds, cultivating virtues, and benefiting sentient beings while remaining unattached to any inherent reality of these actions or their results.

This profound understanding allows them to engage in boundless compassionate activity, employing various skillful means to liberate sentient beings across all realms, even sacrificing their bodies, while remaining undefiled by worldly existence.

These skillful means involve teaching practices like generosity and precepts while simultaneously revealing the emptiness (śūnyatā) of all phenomena—including the practices themselves, practitioners, and their results—to liberate beings from deluded attachments. Thus, Bodhisattvas, abiding in this ultimate non-dual emptiness where nothing can be gained or lost, compassionately cultivate all spiritual paths and attain enlightenment, which is described as a conventional truth for the benefit of sentient beings."

This path requires practicing virtues like the Six Pāramitās with non-abiding wisdom, understanding the inherent emptiness of both practice and its results while maintaining an unwavering resolve for supreme enlightenment. Ultimately, purifying a Buddha-field commences with a Bodhisattva eradicating coarse bodily, verbal, and mental actions, which include unwholesome deeds, attachments to spiritual attainments, and straying from the fundamental tenets of the path."

The text further clarifies that all Bodhisattvas are definitively assured of Buddhahood from their initial aspiration, regardless of their current stage.

It emphasizes that all good dharmas are integrated within Prajñāpāramitā, and these unattached powers are crucial for purifying Buddha-fields and maturing sentient beings, which are prerequisites for attaining supreme perfect enlightenment. The text differentiates Bodhisattvas from Buddhas by noting that Bodhisattvas are ""on the path"" cultivating practices, while Buddhas have ""achieved the fruit"" by perfectly realizing the emptiness of all phenomena and the equality of the Four Noble Truths.

He further defines true purity as the ""equality"" of all dharmas—their fundamental suchness and non-differentiation—which transcends both conditioned and unconditioned states and cannot be ""traversed"" or ""attained"" even by Buddhas, as they embody it. Despite this ultimate non-distinction, Bodhisattvas, propelled by compassion and through skillful means, cultivate practices and make vows for the sake of liberating sentient beings, performing these actions without clinging to their inherent reality or any notion of a separate 'self' or 'other'."

323,成實論,T 1646 (15),$nti/t1646_15.txt,"The text elucidates zhi-guan as the twin pillars of Buddhist practice, where zhi (cessation) temporarily suppresses defilements and guan (insight) ultimately eradicates them through true wisdom, calming the mind and cultivating discernment. It addresses how momentary mental states like dhyana can be cultivated through gradual accumulation and persistent effort, rejecting the idea that they are uncultivable. True wisdom is identified as the understanding of emptiness and non-self, distinguishing it from conventional thought and asserting that the path to liberation culminates in the direct realization of cessation, rather than merely contemplating the Four Noble Truths sequentially. This ultimate wisdom, though encompassing ""all dharmas as non-self,"" primarily targets the five aggregates of clinging to dismantle the self-view."

It details the three wisdoms—from hearing, reflection, and cultivation—and the four unimpeded understandings, highlighting their role in comprehending profound truths. The text extensively debates whether Nirvana is an existent entity or merely the ultimate cessation of aggregates, further elaborating on numerous wisdoms, including those associated with phenomena, non-contention, aspiration, and the six supernormal powers, all culminating in the complete exhaustion of defilements."

While Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas can achieve liberation from defilements, only Bodhisattvas, propelled by profound compassion, undertake the arduous cultivation of these stages over countless kalpas to attain complete Buddhahood, thereby making the three vehicles possible. Entry into the first stage, ""Joyful,"" necessitates the cultivation of eight virtues, including deeply planted good roots, pure practices, and a resolute, compassionate mind, which enables a Bodhisattva to make a firm vow to save all beings after achieving self-liberation. This foundational stage signifies a definitive step towards ultimate Buddhahood, bringing immense, unparalleled joy due to the irreversible commitment and the vast suffering already overcome."

The ""Chapter on Pure Land"" then enumerates twenty-seven practices essential for purifying this stage, including cultivating strong faith, deep compassion, and diligent dharma practice, while eschewing deceit and upholding the precepts. Lastly, the ""Chapter on Vows"" delineates six key aspirations, such as honoring all Buddhas, protecting their Dharma, guiding all sentient beings towards enlightenment, and enabling the understanding of all phenomena as equal through emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. These chapters collectively define the virtuous attributes, essential cultivation methods, and profound commitments of a Bodhisattva entering the Mahayana path."

It then contrasts this with the ""pure land,"" describing its characteristics through a Buddha's perfect virtues, Dharma, enlightened assembly, adorned world, and the boundless compassionate power that stems from bodhisattvas' great vows. The text further elaborates on specific great vows and their ultimate, endless fulfillments, which are tied to the cessation of all phenomena, beings, and time. Finally, the ""Arousing the Bodhi Mind"" chapter outlines seven causes for generating bodhicitta, distinguishing that only those rooted in a Buddha's direct guidance, the protection of the Dharma, or profound compassion guarantee the definite attainment of Buddhahood."

It then distinguishes between retrogressing and non-retrogressing Bodhisattvas, outlining five key characteristics for the latter: an equal mind towards all beings, absence of jealousy, refraining from criticizing Dharma masters, delight in profound Dharma, and lack of craving for veneration. Conversely, a retrogressing Bodhisattva displays a lack of resolve, attachment to worldly gain, deceit, and disbelief in emptiness, while true progress towards non-retrogression involves a deep understanding of selflessness, the non-dual nature of Dharma, the formless essence of Bodhi, and seeing beyond the Buddha's physical attributes. Ultimately, an Avinivartanīya Bodhisattva possesses unwavering faith in emptiness, maintains pure conduct, fearlessly overcomes all obstacles, including Māra's temptations, and steadfastly pursues the Mahāyāna path with an irreversible commitment."

It introduces an ""easy path"" (易行道) that, despite an initial emphasis on strenuous practice, enables swift achievement of non-retrogression through faith and skillful means. This path primarily involves reverently reciting and holding the names of numerous Buddhas, such as Amitabha, and a multitude of Bodhisattvas across the ten directions and three times. Furthermore, the text expands this easy practice to include sincere repentance for all past and present misdeeds, earnest exhortation for Buddhas to teach and remain in the world, joyful rejoicing in all beings' merits, and the dedication of all accumulated merits towards supreme enlightenment for the benefit of all."

It then elaborates on the Bodhisattva's practice of generosity (dāna pāramitā), driven by profound compassion to liberate all beings from suffering, which entails giving away all possessions and even one's own body, not for personal gain but with clear understanding of its specific meritorious results. This pure generosity, performed with wisdom of emptiness, no-form, and no-wish, and dedicated towards unsurpassed enlightenment for the welfare of all beings, is distinguished from defiled forms and cultivated for the sake of boundless giving and ultimate wisdom."

The text then guides lay Bodhisattvas to firmly uphold the Five Precepts, while intensely illustrating the numerous drawbacks of household life and worldly attachments, thereby fostering detachment, universal compassion, and the practice of the six perfections.

A key instruction is to cultivate deep compassion for monastics who transgress precepts, cautioning against judgment and stressing the unknowability of their inner states and potential for enlightenment. The householder should also aspire to monastic life, reverently engage with the Sangha, offer support, and dedicate all merit towards unsurpassed Bodhi for the benefit of all beings.

It then elaborates on 'ten dharmas,' beginning with faith, which progressively lead to the purification of the First Bodhisattva Bhumi, enabling profound spiritual insight. Chapter 20 specifically expounds on the practice of mindfulness of the Buddha (念佛), providing a meticulous and poetic description of the Buddha's thirty-two major marks and eighty minor marks, intricately linking each to the virtuous deeds that brought it about.

The comprehensive rebuttal asserts that Buddha's wisdom is indeed boundless and knows all five categories of phenomena, explaining apparent limitations as skillful means, pedagogical displays, or the manifestation of unalterable karma. Thus, the text firmly establishes the Buddha's complete and unobstructed knowledge, distinguishing their actions from true ignorance and affirming their unique, all-encompassing wisdom that only teaches what leads to ultimate liberation."

The text then systematically outlines core Bodhisattva practices to cultivate and evils to avoid, categorizing them by number from one to ten, encompassing various Buddhist tenets from single-pointed diligence to the ten wholesome paths and the ten unwholesome actions. A ""true Bodhisattva"" is defined not by empty vows but by possessing 32 specific excellent qualities, such as deep compassion, diligent cultivation of good roots, and freedom from attachment to lesser paths, which enable them to manifest boundless wisdom and aid.

The text further elaborates that these fundamental ten wholesome paths constitute the essential foundation not only for fortunate rebirths but also for the liberation achieved by Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas.

It systematically refutes various philosophical assertions—regarding causality, action, perception, aggregates, and elements—by demonstrating their lack of inherent existence through the 'eight negations' and other dialectical arguments. This text’s core method is to dismantle all conceptual elaborations (戲論), guiding practitioners toward a profound understanding of emptiness and dependent origination.

This deconstruction extends to the agent and act, the notion of an abiding self or 'person', and the relationship between fire and fuel, demonstrating that these entities are neither identical nor distinct, nor can they arise dependently in a substantial way without logical fallacies. The text further refutes the possibility of definitively establishing the beginning, end, or origin of suffering through self-causation, other-causation, both, or uncausedness, while also showing that conditioned phenomena are illusory and empty of fixed self-nature, comparable to a banana tree's core. All such analyses aim to reveal the emptiness (śūnyatā) of phenomena, not as another fixed view, but as a means to transcend all conceptual attachments and liberate from the illusion of substantial existence and conjunction."

This understanding allows one to transcend the extreme views of eternalism and annihilationism, revealing a middle way where phenomena are neither truly existent nor truly non-existent.

It asserts that understanding emptiness (śūnyatā), identified with dependent origination, is crucial for validating the Buddhist path, as only non-inherent existence allows for change, cause-and-effect, and liberation. Through rigorous logical analysis, it dismantles various speculative views about the self and the world, highlighting the distinction between conventional and ultimate truths.

The text also challenges the inherent existence of phenomena, unity, and causality, asserting that all conditioned things, including good karma, ultimately lead to suffering if clung to.

Moving to causality and permanence, the treatise dismisses both the pre-existence and non-existence of effects in causes, along with the unchanging nature of entities like space, time, or nirvana, demonstrating how these concepts are riddled with logical flaws and ultimately lead to absurdities.

The Pārājika concerning killing arose when monks, deeply disgusted by their bodies from impurity meditation, resorted to suicide or induced others to kill them, prompting the Buddha to establish the rule and recommend mindfulness of breathing as a safer practice. The Pārājika of falsely claiming spiritual attainments was instituted after monks exaggerated their spiritual progress for food during a famine, an act the Buddha denounced as the gravest theft, though he also clarified cases of genuine misunderstanding by advanced disciples.

The two aniyata rules concern monks sitting alone with women in inappropriate settings, where the severity of the offense—either parajika, sanghavasesa, or pacittiya—is determined by the monk's confession or the testimony of a trustworthy laywoman.

The third rule mandates that bhikṣus obtaining ""out-of-season"" cloth must promptly make it into a robe or, if more material is needed, may only hold it for up to one month to acquire the remainder, after which further delay incurs the same offense.

This council established the core Buddhist teachings, though some minor points were disputed by Purana. A century later, the Second Council of 700 Arahants in Vaishali was called to address ten unlawful practices, such as the acceptance of gold and silver by the Vajji bhikṣus.

While worldly pleasures and even some virtuous actions are acknowledged as providing temporary happiness, the Buddha clarifies that only Mahayana Bodhisattvas, through their profound wisdom and non-attachment, truly understand how these are ultimately intertwined with suffering and are therefore free from their grasp.

Through a detailed dialogue, the Buddha clarifies the mind's non-dual nature—neither bound nor unbound—and its conditioned relationship with defilements, ultimately revealing the true, unconditioned mind as the basis for the Bodhisattva's ultimate liberation from samsara and Mara's influence."

The ninth virtue involves practicing ""emptiness samadhi,"" where the Buddha explains that all phenomena are inherently empty (不可得故), and this cultivation leads to seeing Buddha-nature and profound insight, distinct from mundane perception. The tenth virtue entails cultivating the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, leading to the realization and teaching of Nirvana's true nature as permanent, blissful, self, and pure, and revealing Buddha-nature. The Buddha then predicts that after his passing, ""evil bhikshus"" will reject this sutra due to their misunderstanding of its teachings on permanence and the One Vehicle, but those who believe even a half-sentence will attain Buddha-nature and Nirvana."

The Buddha explains Buddha-nature as the Middle Way and First Principle Emptiness, defining it as permanent, joyful, self, and pure, though obscured in sentient beings by ignorance. He clarifies that while Buddhas perceive this nature clearly, Bodhisattvas see it less distinctly through cultivating ten virtues and the Śūraṅgama Samādhi, emphasizing that this inherent Buddha-nature is the seed of supreme enlightenment in all beings, even identified as the true 'Self' for specific teaching purposes."

The Buddha further clarifies that though the Bodhi-mind can be cultivated or may temporarily retreat due to certain factors, Buddha-nature itself is an eternal and immutable potential within all sentient beings, even the most defiled, ensuring their ultimate attainment of supreme enlightenment. He elaborates on the karmic causes for the thirty-two marks of a Buddha, illustrating how diligent practice leads to an unretreating Bodhi-mind and the full realization of this inconceivable Buddha-nature."

The Buddha explains that despite impermanence, a continuous process of defilements and karma binds beings through deluded views, while the cultivation of precepts, concentration, and wisdom through the Eightfold Noble Path leads to liberation. He clarifies that Buddha-nature is a shared, unchanging explanatory cause, not a generative one, which is realized through dedicated practice, illustrating these points with various analogies. The Buddha concludes by recounting his past lives and vows, explaining his karmic reasons for choosing Kuśinagara as the place for his final Parinirvana."

The Buddha refutes the heretics' views on ""self"" and impermanence, asserting that while all other phenomena are impermanent and without a true self, the Tathāgata and Nirvāṇa are uniquely characterized by permanence, bliss, true self, and purity. He explains his parinirvāṇa not as a final end but as a profound meditation for the liberation of beings, defining Nirvana as a formless, unconditioned state free from conventional attributes, attainable through balanced cultivation of samadhi, wisdom, and relinquishment. The narrative also highlights the exemplary qualities of his chief disciples, concluding that ultimately, only the Tathāgata fully embodies the perfect wisdom and liberation that truly ornaments the sacred Sāla grove."

He stresses the indispensable, complementary roles of both meditation (samādhi) and wisdom (prajñā) for bodhisattvas, explaining their appropriate cultivation according to specific ""times"" to achieve supreme enlightenment. The text further clarifies that karmic retribution is not always fixed; through wisdom, sincere repentance, and diligent cultivation of ""body, precepts, mind, and wisdom,"" heavy karma can be lightened in this life, while light karma for the ignorant can lead to severe future suffering. This emphasis on the transformative power of wisdom and wholesome actions, rather than being bound by immutable retribution, highlights the path to liberation and the ultimate realization of unconditioned Nirvana."

The Buddha refutes this, explaining through analogies like crossing a river or finding water in a well that while Buddha-nature is universally present, active cultivation of the path, including faith and wisdom, is indispensable for its realization. He clarifies that Buddha-nature is not a static entity but encompasses profound qualities like great compassion and faith, which manifest through diligent practice, and concludes that without such effort, this inherent potential remains obscured."

He detailed Good Star's persistent lack of faith and destructive wrong views, which led to his self-inflicted spiritual downfall despite prolonged instruction. Nevertheless, the Buddha clarified that while present and obstructing future good roots can be severed, the ultimate Buddha-nature is eternal, and his ""power of knowing roots"" enabled him to adapt his teachings and actions (like allowing ordination) to plant distant seeds of good for even the most difficult beings."

In each case, the Buddha emphasizes that his disciples often misinterpreted these expedient teachings as definitive statements, failing to grasp his true, deeper intent.

It identifies those who ""cut off good roots"" as intelligent individuals who deny fundamental Buddhist tenets like causality, moral consequences, or the holy path, often through intricate but erroneous reasoning. The Buddha then elucidates the multifaceted concept of Buddha-nature for all beings, including those who have severed good roots, explaining through ""fourfold answers"" that it is simultaneously existent and non-existent, neither internal nor external, and eternally present, guaranteeing ultimate enlightenment. This is further elaborated by describing the Buddha's various pedagogical approaches and seven types of speech, all skillfully employed to guide sentient beings toward the profound understanding of these truths."

Furthermore, the scripture defines Nirvana as the ""fruit of detachment"" with a cognitive cause, not a generating one, and details the Eightfold Noble Path as the ""sramana"" and its fruit as the eradication of defilements.

The Buddha reconciles apparent contradictions by explaining that while ordinary beings' forms are impermanent due to defilements, his own Buddha-body is permanent because it is free from such impurities. Attaining this undefiled state, known as ""pure Brahman practice"" or the ""King of Medicine,"" involves systematically observing and eradicating the causes and effects of the three outflows—desire, existence, and ignorance—through the Noble Eightfold Path.

The text meticulously defines various other wrong views such as eternalism, annihilationism, and the misperception of pleasure, purity, and self, explaining their deceptive origins in the four inversions (viparyāsas). It thoroughly analyzes how these erroneous beliefs, stemming from mistaking the impermanent for permanent, suffering for pleasure, impure for pure, and non-self for self, are ultimately abandoned through the correct understanding of the Four Noble Truths. Additionally, the discourse clarifies the nature of 'wrong knowledge' and its role in perpetuating these binding delusions that prevent liberation."

It carefully distinguishes that while two minds cannot be mutually causal, they can be mutually conditioned, allowing later mental states to perceive earlier ones as objects. The text further elaborates on the scope of ""non-self"" insight, explaining how defiled wisdom might initially view all phenomena broadly, whereas undefiled wisdom focuses decisively on specific truths.

It meticulously defines anantara-pratyaya as preceding mental events that directly condition subsequent ones, specifying its absence in future phenomena, form, and mind-non-associated formations. The text then delves into the mechanism of memory, refuting theories of a permanent self or substance, instead proposing that recall stems from ""similar habitual wisdom"" fostered by strong prior mental activity and various experiential similarities.

The treatise then systematically details how the twelve links are distributed across one's life: two in the past (ignorance and formations), two in the future (birth and old age/death), and eight in the present (consciousness to becoming).

The first Pārājika, prohibiting all forms of sexual intercourse, is then formulated and systematically expanded through various cases involving humans, non-humans, and animals, across different orifices and circumstances, marking such acts as an expulsion offense from the monastic community."

It describes how monks committed sexual acts with a woman whose limbs were amputated, a mad sleeping woman, and a recently deceased woman's corpse, all of which the Buddha declared pārājika, emphasizing that any penetration of a living, sleeping, mad, or dead body constitutes the offense. The text then presents two cases of stealing: the bhikṣu Dādhika taking royal timber without permission, and another monk taking a washerman's cloth from an empty field, both leading to pārājika as the Buddha clarified that taking what is not given, regardless of perceived ownership status, location, or the object's condition, is a grave transgression.

The false speech precept is established following monks' self-praise for material gain, contrasting it with a case where a monk's mistaken belief of arhatship was deemed *adhimāna* rather than an intentional lie. Thus, a monk who, without genuine knowledge, falsely claims superhuman qualities or noble insights, faces expulsion from the Sangha, unless it is a case of genuine presumption and not malicious deception."

The second Pārājika concerns falsely claiming superhuman spiritual attainments, presenting instances of both deliberate deceit and genuine self-deception (adhi-māna) regarding one's meditative progress.

Furthermore, it outlines regulations for alms bowls, limiting their possession to ten days before requiring purification, and prohibiting monks from begging for a new bowl unless their current one is severely damaged with less than five ""seams"" of repair.

Through logical inquiry, analogies, and direct exposition, the text demonstrates how cultivating insight into the true nature of these aggregates leads to the eradication of ""I-conceit"" and wrong views, thus freeing practitioners from attachment, suffering, and the cycle of rebirth.

Through deep understanding and eradication of desire and self-views regarding these aggregates, one abandons attachment, breaks free from Māra's bondage, and realizes complete mental liberation.

The Buddha instructs that realizing the non-self nature (anātman) of these aggregates is crucial for liberation, stressing the urgent need for spiritual effort, likened to extinguishing a head on fire. To this end, the text repeatedly advocates for the diligent cultivation of core Buddhist practices such as the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Four Right Efforts, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the development of tranquil abiding and insight (śamatha-vipaśyanā).

By cultivating this right view, practitioners develop aversion, abandon craving and attachment, and attain mental liberation, thereby exhausting defilements and realizing the end of rebirth.
